            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOUR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not one of the leaſt remarkable aſſurances of the ſage Conduct of thoſe, who Govern this Monarchy, to ſee how their high Prudence and incomparable Wiſdom remove the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> ſo far from our Kingdom, that the Governours of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers have leiſure to ſtudy and compoſe Books. It is in the fruition of this profound repoſe, wherein I enjoy, even in the midſt of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of War, an opportunity to render in ſome degree, my retiredneſs more profitable, by compoſing this Work, which I now expoſe to Publique Cenſure and Approbation. I believe (Reader) though Fortune was not pleaſed to ordain me for the management of more ſublime affairs; yet ſhe gave me leave to ſee, that if ſhe had pleaſed to call me, I might happily, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
<pb facs="tcp:96822:5"/>
my ſelf without diſhonour or diſgrace; and that he who cauſed <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth to ſpeak ſo nobly, and ſo many other Kings, might have bin capable to ſerve <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourteenth, at leaſt, under their orders and directions, who councel ſo ſucceſsfully, if in ſtead of a Command in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote extremities of the State, and moſt imbroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led borders and limits, Fortune had vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to call me to Court, and there appointed my imployments. In effect, though naturally I had no Genius or diſpoſition to noble enterpriſes, and had contracted from my birth an abſolute ſtupidity; yet ſo many great Princes whom I have had the honour to attend, ſo many ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Courts which I have ſeen, ſo many people, and ſo different in their Manners, Cuſtoms, and Laws, which I have viſited, ſo many Armies, Wars, and various affairs, wherein I have been engaged, both voluntarily and under command; ſo many Grand Perſonages, with whom I have had ſociety and friendſhip, ſo many remarkable events that I have obſerved, together with thoſe precious reliques of Prudence exhauſted out of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> All this (I ſay) is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to inform my judgment, and for Art and education to compleat in me, what Nature could not. And I think (Reader) it were not poſſible for me to revive Kings to a quick and lively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, without ſome competent abilities in me: and I dare preſume to believe, though my deſign appear full of confidence, yet it may be excuſed from being cenſured raſh.</p>
            <p>I have then made choice of twenty Princes (out
<pb facs="tcp:96822:5"/>
of univerſal Hiſtory) and have ſelected the moſt eminent actions of their reigns for the ſubject of this diſcourſe; endeavouring herein to dive and pierce into thoſe reaſons and cauſes which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled them to their reſolutions. In this I ſeem to be (in a kind) admitted to the Cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of theſe Princes (who are in their graves,) and by moſt probable conjectures, have hinted at thoſe profound reaſons which ſo directed them. Thus guided by the light of Hiſtory, I have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to diſcover thoſe ſecret and concealed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of State, and ſo to remonſtrate the events of Councels and grand Enterpriſes, undertaken with ſo high deliberations. To this end, that if Princes and Monarchs admit not of inſtruction riſing from their inferiors; yet that they may not refuſe it flowing from their equals. This being compoſed by ſome Politick reflexions, which are as the muſcles and nerves of the body, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling all the ſeveral parts, make up and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover (Reader) the aim and end of this Work.</p>
            <p>Now whether the Builder have the skil to make this high deſign practical, and ſo to cauſe this ſtately Piece admired and loved according to the beauty of the Model; it is for you (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to judge; for <hi>it becomes no one to be Judge and Supreme in his own affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have confin'd my ſelf to theſe 7 or 8 laſt ages of Time in the election of theſe Princes, &amp; thoſe others, which may follow in the ſecond part of this Work. The rather, becauſe already ſo many learned Hiſtorians having travelled to <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> have written ſo accurately and fully, that
<pb facs="tcp:96822:6"/>
nothing is left that may farther relate the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and magnificence of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. So many exquiſite Authors, (converſant in the affairs of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes)</hi> have follow'd <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that nothing of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can be ſuperadded: and ſo many learned Pens have written of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; commented on his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi> that nothing can be found out to more illuſtrate thoſe relations. It may be ſaid of thoſe renowned ages of Antiquity in the words of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, That nothing is new under the Sun:</hi> and that they have been ſo often examined, that thoſe rare and precious ſubjects are rendred now more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and ſo leſs admired. As I then walk in a path leſs obvious to common foot-ſteps, ſo am I reſtrained to more confined and choicer limits; wherefore I have not troubled their famous um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra's, whom an innocent kind of Magick hath ſo often ſummoned from their Royal Tombs: but leaving thoſe Princely Hero's to the repoſe of their ſepultures, I have preſumed to ſummon others from their retirements of obſcurity, to preſent their Nobleſt Actions to the light.</p>
            <p>I am aſſured (Reader) their apparition will not affright you with their Preſence, nor their voice daunt your ſoul: I conjure you then to hear, and to give a favourable audience to theſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious dead Princes. This is a reſpect due to their high qualities, and which they exactly look for from thoſe who are moſt rude and unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to Thrones, Scepters, and Crowns.</p>

            <head>Curia Politiae.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the hearts of all men in general (as the Scriptures teſtifie) are ſo unſearchable that none but God can find them out, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate and diſcover the ſecrets thereof. Certainly the hearts of <hi>Princes</hi> are ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Abyſſes, as all the ſubtlety of the People cannot ſound or fathom: <hi>The hearts of Kings are in the hands of God.</hi> It is Gods own aſſurance, and he alone is able to diſcern and know them. <hi>As Kings reign by him alone,</hi> ſo he alone knows by what Maxims he will have them rule. The diſtance is ſo far betwixt us and the <hi>Prima Mobilia,</hi> that their motions are indiſcernable to us; they train and lead us on after them, but we neither know how nor why we follow them: And as they are infinitely above us, ſo if our curioſity ſhould ſoare aloft to diſcover the wayes and ends of their Revolutions, the moſt elevated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits would find themſelves infinitely low and ſhort in their capacities.</p>
            <p>If God (as he names himſelf) be <hi>an inviſible God,</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who are the living Images of God, are in that attribute like unto him. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſometimes ſaid, <hi>We have ſeen the living God, we ſhall dye and not live.</hi> It is little leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to peep and prye into the ſecrets of <hi>Princes.</hi> If <hi>God be a conſuming fire,</hi> and is concealed in the fiery flaming buſh, the Majeſty of Soveraigns hath a near reſemblance to this inacceſſible light, which never ſuffers it ſelf entirely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible no more then God himſelf. And if the ſplendor of the Celeſtial Majeſty commanded the <hi>Cherubims to cover their</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96822:9"/>
               <hi>faces with their wings:</hi> the glory of terreſtrial Soveraignty is ſo illuſtrious and bright, that it not only tranſcendeth, but diminiſheth all inferiour lights and luminations. The ſtrongeſt ſighted Eagles are too weak to dare to look ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly on theſe glorious Suns. Theſe mortal Deities may then ſay (but in all humble reverence to the great King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,) <hi>I am what I am,</hi> without a farther diſcovery of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Royal pleaſure. And the derrogation is leſs, or none at all; ſeeing the holy Scriptures have admitted Kings to be ſtiled <hi>Gods on Earth.</hi> The Fable of <hi>Prometheus</hi> teacheth little leſs, but that it is highly dangerous to deſire to know the depth of Princes thoughts, and ſo to have a will to reſemble thoſe moſt ſublime Perſons. <hi>Give me what you pleaſe,</hi> (ſaid a ſage Courtier to his Lord and Maſter) <hi>ſeeing you give me not leave to have a ſhare in your ſecrets.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great danger of taſting the forbidden fruit, there is a natural Curioſity in all men to know Good and Evil; which hath derived it ſelf from the firſt man to all poſterity. As for the concealments of ſecrets, they enflame the mind to a greater ardor of knowing them: And it is received as a common Maxim, <hi>In great enterpriſes, it is noble enough to dare to wiſh them. And the more Princes endeavour to conceal their thoughts, the more the people labour to divine them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phyſick is not the ſole Art, which may be termed, <hi>The Art or Myſtery of Conjectures:</hi> Vulgar Policie hath no other Foundations, and worketh by no other Principles. <hi>Tiberius</hi> thought fit to conceal himſelf amongſt the Rocks of the Iſle of <hi>Caprea,</hi> and to envelop his true reſentment of affairs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the veil of ambiguous terms: and out of theſe equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal notions, <hi>Rome</hi> toiled to explicate his moſt enigmatical obſcurities, and myſterious Oracles. When the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt fell on <hi>Sejanus</hi> head, the moſt ignorant of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple took the vanity to brag and boaſt, that they foreſaw the tempeſt long before that accident arived. And that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had not ſo much as a thought in his ſolitude, which they had not formerly divined in the Capitol, or foreſeen at the foot of Mount <hi>Aventine:</hi> ſo true it is, that every <hi>one hath a ſtrong opinion of his worth and great abilities, and boldly preſumes to cenſure raſhly the intentions of Princes.</hi> In concluſion, it may be ſaid to this purpoſe, that a Kingdom hath as many
<pb facs="tcp:96822:9"/>
Miniſters of State, as men; and that all are aſſiſtants to the higheſt Councels, and impart their opinions to the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace and War; and that the great Engine of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment hath no reſults ſo ſecret, but what are abſolutely diſcovered; This is the infirmity and diſeaſe of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Ages; but if it was ever Epidemical and ſpreading over the earth, if ever Curioſity did exerciſe the Parts and Policie of the moſt refined Wits, or the leſs ingenuous, and provoked the whole world to admire and talk. It was doubtleſs then, when the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſurrendred his Empire to his brother, and his Kingdom into the hands of his ſon.</p>
            <p>All men were amazed to ſee a ſoul ſo ambitious of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, freely to renounce Glory and Granduer, to paſs from a Throne to an Hermitage, and from the high quality of a puiſſant Soveraign, to the low Fortune of a Private Perſon. And as they ſtood at gaze, ſo each one deſired to ſearch into the intentions of this Prince, and to gueſs at thoſe reaſons which tranſported him to an Action ſo extraordinary. Now as ſometimes the grave Sages pleaſe to intermix themſelves with the common people, and in their condeſcentions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to be trod on in a croud; let us preſume to make our conjectures of him, who lives not in our Age, and whoſe action is above the reach of our knowledge. And let us obſerve this moſt Illuſtrious Prince (now in his ſolitude) ſpeaking to the Queens his Royal Siſters, who were his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in his voyage, when he paſſed out of <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> after this grand Action.</p>

               <head>THE DISCOVERSE OF THE EMPEROVR CHARLES THE FIFTH, TO THE QUEENES HIS DEAR SISTERS.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not but that at this inſtant the whole world is ready to Deſcant on that ſtupendious action I have undertaken; and that the greateſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plators imploy (at preſent) their deepeſt <hi>Policy, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> to divine and ſearch out the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of my reſolutions. This action is of ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and extraordinary nature, as may render a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment to the curioſity of the moſt profound and moſt capeable underſtandings; In the undertaking whereof, and although I live in an Age wherein I have theſe more illuſtrious &amp; great Perſonages to beare witneſſe with me; <hi>Philip King of England; Maximilian King of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Elianor Queene of France and Portugall, Mary Queene of Hungarie, Emanuell Philibert Duke of Savoy, Chriſtiana Daughter to the King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke and Dutches of Lorraine:</hi> All the <hi>Knights</hi> of the Order of <hi>the golden Fleece,</hi> all the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spaine;</hi> all Perſons of Eminent condition in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and an infinite number of other people; yet I may ſay, and my reaſon tells me, that I may well doubt, whether poſterity can bee perſwaded to beleeve, what I have undertaken to effect. All Ages furniſh us with too many examples of <hi>Vſurpers</hi> of <hi>Empires and Crownes;</hi> and of Princes who have left their <hi>Scepters:</hi> but in the univerſall hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of times, it is moſt rare to heare of any, who voluntarily quitted Soverainty without conſtraint: I ſhall onely except <hi>the Emperour Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian;</hi> and (perhaps) I ſhall have none to imitate me. The world ſees that I have transferred to my Son, all the <hi>Kingdomes, Provinces, and Iſles,</hi> of which I was <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> both in the <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>old World,</hi> that I have diſpatched the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> to my Brother <hi>Ferdinando King of the Romans,</hi> to preſent him with the Scepter and Crowne Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall; I have (already) been obſerved to with-draw from a Royall Palace, and to have retired to a private houſe at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and thence to have deſcended to an humble <hi>Hermitage:</hi> But (it is poſſible) that thouſands can never judge rightly, nor ſearch directly into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96822:11"/>
of ſo great a change; If I had loſt many famous Battailes, If the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Barbares</hi> had invaded the <hi>Provinces of the Empire;</hi> or had they all diſloyally revolted, then might men have ſaid or cenſured, that I had diſcreetly quitted, what I had not been able longer to protect and guard; and that I had done well to abandon voluntarily, that which might have beene violently forced from me. But the whole earth knows, That ſince my age of <hi>ſixteene yeares,</hi> (when firſt I bore a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to the age of <hi>fifty ſixe yeares</hi> (when at laſt I ſurrendred them all) my life and all my Adventures, were nothing elſe, but a <hi>Concatenation of victories and Tryumphes, and a glorious continuation of moſt renowned ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes;</hi> I have enjoyed <hi>forty yeares</hi> the Royalties &amp; Kingdomes of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which I have now conferred on my Son, and <hi>thirty ſixe yeares</hi> the Majeſty of the Empire, which I have ſurrendred to my Brother with ſuch ſucceſſe and glory, that I dare ſay (without vanity) amongſt the greateſt <hi>Caeſars,</hi> of all my predeceſſors, <hi>Charles the great onely</hi> beares compariſon with <hi>Charles the fifth.</hi> In effect, what Prince can be preferred before <hi>Charles,</hi> ſince <hi>Charles</hi> was preferred before <hi>Francis?</hi> This high Soule (whom glory inflam'd to become my mortall Enemy; and whom the Renown of my victories ſo oft amaz'd, aſpir'd to the <hi>Empire</hi> as well as I; and left nothing unattempted that might make his way leſſe difficult; he moved by all ſecret engines to gaine intelligence, &amp; make his party in <hi>Germany,</hi> he allarm'd the towns along the River of <hi>Rheine,</hi> with the great numbers of his Forſes and Armies, the more to terrifie and diſpirit the <hi>Princes Electors;</hi> notwithſtanding the Genius of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> was more prevalent then that of <hi>Anthony,</hi> although that of <hi>Anthony</hi> was more ſubtill then thoſe of other Men, yet (mauger all deſpite of this illuſtrious Rivall) I obtained the Empire to which hee pretended, and gained the <hi>Throne</hi> with more honour, (as all <hi>Europe</hi> knowes) then my competitor: This was not the ſole advantage which fortune crowned me with in degrees above my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemies; But on the contrary, ſhee ſeem'd willing that I ſhould bee borne in ſuch an Age, that ſhould chiefly ſerve for my renowne; And the <hi>Tryumphs of Charles,</hi> had not received their compleate orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if this illuſtrious conqueſt had not attended his Royall Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ott. I know not (my deare ſiſter) if it may not prove an errour in my judgement, or a blemiſh to my wiſedome to remember you (at this reencounter) of the impriſonment of your husband; firſt, becauſe that he is not now alive, and then becauſe he was my priſoner: yet the relation is a ſweet temptation to a ſoule ſo ambitious of true glory, as that of mine; and to ſilence it, is not an ordinary difficulty. And now (to diſcourſe the paſſages as they fall) to take Priſoner a King with his ſword in his hand, in the midſt of the field, the battaile being all invelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in blood and fire, the forces routed, and invironed, the Colours torne, the Squadrons flying, and the maine body in confuſion; ſome dying, and others ſlaine outright; ſuch a King (I ſay) though intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquiſhed, is no leſſe glorious then his conquerer. Permitt mee then (ſweet Siſter) to call to my memory that Battaile of <hi>Pavie,</hi> as one of the moſt eminent Actions of all my Raigne, and if you ſadly call to mind that this <hi>Prince</hi> (whom <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> ſaw my Priſoner) was your husband; yet forget not (if you pleaſe) that I am alſo your <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> But now to paſſe from Forraine to Domeſtick affaires, from Warres abroad to civill Diſſentions, and ſo from <hi>Spaine</hi> to <hi>Flanders;</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96822:11"/>
what honour did I not gain; when I did chaſtiſe the Revolted City of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> this Rebellion was ſo great, that the conſequence might have been terrible, and yet to ſee this fire extinguiſhed, before the flame grew higher, I was forced to have confidence in an Antient Enemy newly reconciled; and enter into a Province of a <hi>Prince,</hi> whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of <hi>Priſon,</hi> and to take aſſurance from one whom I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to pay a Ranſom: In a word, J was conſtrained to adventure the hazard of loſing all, that by my bold endeavours I might preſerve <hi>Flanders;</hi> no Policy (more ſuſpicious then mine) could well over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch ſcruples in this conjuncture when (during the time after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation) the Rebels found out wayes to foment new Revolts, and to corroborate their unjuſt uſurpation. As for me, I uſed all waies, and meanes; and as ſoon as my reaſon diſcovered, that I could not ſuffer the contempt of that Rebellious Town without great diſgrace, and much diſhonour, I commended <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Fortune to the mercy of the Wind and Waves; I ſlighted that which others thought I had cauſe to fear; I marched throughout all <hi>France</hi> Heroickly, and at laſt chaſtiſed this Popular City; and reduced her to her Devoirs. Truly <hi>Francis</hi> uſed generoſity well beſeeming him; (But I think I may ſay in this occaſion) my courage well beſeemed me. Now to return from <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> if we look toward <hi>Font-Arabia,</hi> what new Trophies hath not ſhe diſcovered. This Siege coſt me no more dayes, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny believed it would have expended years. And it fell out there, what <hi>Caeſar</hi> once ſaid <hi>(veni vidi vice)</hi> But (my moſt dear Siſter) that which I relate to you alone, my wiſdome obliges me to deny to all <hi>Europe:</hi> Your diſcretion hath merited this Confidence, and he who hath truſted you with his life, ſhall never fear to truſt you with any ſecret. We tell you then that the gaining of <hi>Rome</hi> addeth a marvellous luſtre to our renown, which others would endeavour to obſcure. It is at her Capitoll where <hi>Caeſars</hi> and the <hi>Emperours</hi> ought to Tryumph, and it is juſt to make this imperious City (the Miſtriſſe of the World) to ſtoop to the power and puiſſance of her chiefe Lords and Maſters But if vertue be ſcrupulous (in this conjunction) and that any thing ſeem too much to ſtruggle with, or diſturbe her victorious magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; let us leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and turne our eyes towards <hi>Boloyn,</hi> which ſaw us receive the <hi>Imperiall Crown</hi> from the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Biſhop; and yet, if ſhe can expect a further ſacrifice to pacifie and appeaſe; and ſo to cauſe her utterly to forget the ſacking of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſhe may (if ſhe pleaſe) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> where ſhe ſhall ſee we have proved the <hi>Buckler</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in repulſing the forces of invincible <hi>Solyman;</hi> who was the greateſt <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſhee ſhall ſee us make head againſt our greateſt Enemy, and to damme up that dangerous Torrent, which threatned the Ruine of all <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp; (Poſſibly) of all <hi>Europe;</hi> but if the Ladie Vertupl eaſe to march with me out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Affrica,</hi> ſhee may look on me there Grapling with the ſame Enemies; That is, the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> the greateſt Foes to Chriſtianity. Who hath not heard of the taking and ſacking of <hi>Gouletta?</hi> and what Climate is ſo remote from the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> as hath not talked of this grand Action; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that almoſt all Chriſtians were ſpectators on the effects of this Warre; where I alone cauſed the <hi>Roman Eagle</hi> to fly in Tryumph, in thoſe places where ſhe never appeard ſince the defeat of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and the victory of <hi>Scipio?</hi> Who hath not underſtood of the flight of <hi>Cairad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>

Who hath not heard of the fame of the taking of <hi>Tunis,</hi> the moſt important, and capitall City of that whole Kingdome? Have wee not cauſe to hope (as the effect of ſo great Atchievements) that <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> ſhall have the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny? That <hi>Algiers</hi> it ſelf ſhall fall within our power? And that all <hi>Aſſrick</hi> ſhall yeeld entirely to the fortune of our Victories? Yes (my dear Siſters) we have cauſe to hope, and the ſucceſſe had been infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to expectation, if the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> had not ſtop'd our progreſſe in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and that wee had not been conſtrain'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne ſpeedily to Sea. It is true, I changed the climate, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with a new ſort of Enemies, but loſt not the leaſt point of good fortune; Victory followed me from <hi>Affrica</hi> to <hi>Germany;</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Cleve</hi> found that I became ſpeedily a Terrible Enemy; I defied him and all his Troops, took him and all his Towns: And if my Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie had not equalized my Valour, I had buried him under the Ruines of his own <hi>Territories.</hi> Then the Error of <hi>Luther</hi> had infected <hi>Germany,</hi> and I could no leſſe then with Fire and Faggot oppoſe the birth of that <hi>dangerous Monſter.</hi> How many Towns did fortifie themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our victorious Armies, which ſaw their own Walls thrown down, and demoliſhed by the ſuccesfull ſtrength of our puiſſant Forces: <hi>Ulmes</hi> yeelded firſt, <hi>Auspurgh</hi> followed quickly after; <hi>Halle</hi> was willing to imitate the one &amp; the other; and above <hi>thirty Towns more</hi> ſubmitted likewiſe: at laſt <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> with her famous Clock (of which all <hi>Europe</hi> talketh) remembers the hour of her ſurpriſe, and that of my Triumph. What ſhall I tell you of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous head of that party, that violent Defender of the <hi>Impoſtures</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> who ſet all <hi>Germany</hi> in Armes, and all the Countries of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> in confuſion? Did it not turn to his diſhonour, and my glory, that God conducted <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his fortune? Having ſo good, ſo great a Pilot, his Ship could not periſh? Did not all <hi>Europe</hi> ſee the very foundation of this Hereſie impriſoned within my power? and hath not that Priſon clearly ſeen, that the Cauſe which I defended was that of Heaven, and that a Robbing of mee, was a Robbing of God? and ſeeing <hi>that God will be for us,</hi> we may demand, <hi>Quis erit contra nos?</hi> Who dare be againſt us? Thus (my dear Siſters) I have had this particular fortune, that almoſt alwayes thoſe who dared to attaque my Perſon, or Forces, have not onely loſt the hopes of Conquering me, but even themſelves, their Forces, their Armies, their Eſtates, and their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is now that this very thought calls to memory the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Francis le Grand,</hi> and his impriſonment, the great advantages which I obtained with thoſe good ſucceſſes which attended: I ſhall conclude with a Narration of my Succeſſes, as the chiefeſt Honour to my greateſt actions. <hi>Hedin</hi> did offer Sacrifice to my memory, and deſired permiſſion to be inſerted in the Schedule of my Triumphs. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roune</hi>

But (perhaps you will ſay unto me) ſince all theſe affaires ſucceed ſo favourably, and that you appeared like a Star ſituated in the Heavens, attended with fortunate aſpects, thereby inabled to Regulate your own deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherefore will you abandone the Helme of that great veſſell which you have ſo proſperouſly governed, transferring thoſe great affairs to a young Pilot; who hath not ſo large experience as you? his high endeavours may be as great, or more, yet, 'tis poſſible, not ſo ſucceſsfull. O (moſt honoured Siſters) it is the deſire of immortall Glory that cauſed me to quit this tranſient ſplendor; and to live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in the memory of men, that I ceaſe to Reign. It is true, that (to this inſtant) fortune hath been ever propitious to me, that ſhe hath followed my Standard that ſhe never was unconſtant unto my party; Nay her favours ſurpaſſed my expectations, and ſeconded all my Ambitions: But I know well this is not allwaies her nature, and I am equally perſwaded that I ought not to be too confident; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed me upon the very higheſt ſtep of glory (to which degree no man aſcended before me) ſhe hath withall elevated me ſo high; that on the view of the circumference where I ſtand, I am invironed with precipices which are able to amaze the greateſt courage. Though I walk ſecurely, (accuſtomed to behold thoſe dangers without fear;) yet one falſe ſtep may cauſe all the glory of my renown to be daſht in peeces, and hazard all the travailes of my whole life to be loſt in an unfortunate moment.

how they look on Conquerours: They would not that they ſhould be ſometime ſucceſsfull, but conſtantly and alwaies; it is not by precedent noble actions, but by the laſt events that they cenſure and judge of the Grandeur of all former Enterprizes; and <hi>when fortune forſakes them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown takes leave with her, and reputation dies and followes no farther;</hi> ſome will ſay that meer chance gave them their advantages, and that their own imprudence deſtroy'd all: and truly if <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, after he had gained the Battell of <hi>Granique,</hi> had loſt that of <hi>Arbella,</hi> he had returned without honour into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> Although (effectively) he had been neither leſſe wiſe nor valiant. Why ſhould not I then fixe a naile in the wheele of this inconſtant Chariot; to ſtop her inſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? and why ſhould the World think it no danger to expoſe to loſſe ſuch high renown obtained with ſo much induſtry? were it not better that I ſhould quit the Company of this mutable Lady, then that ſhee ſhould (coylie) forſake me? And that I ſhould rather deſcend volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily from the Throne, then to expoſe my ſelf to the hazard of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitious fall? A man ought not to flatter and deceive himſelfe in an affaire ſo important as this, my Throne is not more ſecure then that of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and as for <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> was not <hi>Barbary</hi> alone capable to confound him and all his Power? There are fewer Crowns and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters intire (in all the Earth) then thoſe which lie bruiſed and broken under the feet of Fortune. This grand &amp; ſadobject may teach all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (who ſtrike their Subjects with fear) to be daunted and tremble themſelves. It is then with the ſtrength of reaſon, and a conſideration ſo high, that I arrive ſafely on ſhore, having hitherto ſayled ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and ſo much the ſooner; becauſe I can be no greater then I am (or could) reaſonably deſire more; ſhould I then vainly expoſe my ſelfe to Storms, Rocks, Sands, and Shipwrack it ſelfe? Beſides, as Kings have not the immortality of the Gods (if a Chriſtian may be admitted to uſe this Phraſe) ſo they have not their Power: But (on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) are ſubject to the moſt feeble caſualties and all infirmities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. I am remembred by my diſeaſes, which daily increaſe upon me, to take order for my Supream and laſt affaires, for fear of being prevented, and to remit the Scepter of Government (which I cannot longer well ſupport) to the ſhoulders of a Prince more young and vigorous then I, and conſequently, more capable to bear up ſo great a weight with all the Royall dignity of the Empire. The Soul and body (my dear Siſters) are ſo chained together, that the weakneſſe of the one muſt needs communicate infirmitie to the other, and then, when the conſtitution of the one is altered (it is very poſſible) that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the other muſt admit a change: Judge then, after ſo many People, and ſo many Princes have liſtned to my voice, as to an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and followed my opinion as decrees of Heaven (if I had done well to have expoſed my infirmities to the eyes of all the World?) No, the pangs of the Gout are ſo ſharpe and picquant, that they force my Patience to ſighs and Groans; It muſt needs be then greater wiſdome that thoſe cryes ſhall Echo no where but in the deſart, and where noe perſon ſhall over-hear them. Would Men, that I ſhould do like <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who to preſerve the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of his former Power, was obliged to diſguiſe his miſery in an <hi>Iſland,</hi> where he was confined by diſpatching daily Warrants to <hi>Rome</hi> for the death of ſome <hi>Citizen,</hi> for no other end but that <hi>Rome</hi> might know <hi>Tiberius</hi> was ſtill living?

No, this Barbarous proceeding becomes not a Chriſtian, a Prince, nor a Man, and I hate to practice it. For that time that I have had my health, I conceive J have governed my Subjects in ſuch a faſhion, that none (except my Enemies) can be diſpleaſed that I either lived, or reigned. But ſeeing my ſtrength failes me, I ſhall not farther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer mine ambition above the ſafety of my Subjects. Other Princes leave their Crowns to their Children onely at that inſtant when they dye, that is, when they are not fit to weare the Diademe any longer. But as for me, I was never willing that Death ſhould make this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my Sonne; but rather, that he ſhould receive, and hold this Bleſſing from me; and as I was a means to make him live, ſo (before I dyed) I would be a meanes to make him Reign, and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to me more entirely. Moreover (not to conceal any of my thoughts) I know wel that moſt people of the Earth imitate the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the antient people of <hi>Libya,</hi> who adored the Riſing Sun, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the Sun-ſetting. Yes (Royal Ladies) the flouriſhing age of <hi>Philip</hi> withdraws the Subjects hearts from the gray haires of <hi>Charles;</hi> they would regard the latter years of my Reign as an unſeaſonable <hi>cloud</hi> which interpoſed the bright beams of this new <hi>ſtar,</hi> and attend with impatience a thing which (rationally) they ought to fear; and if the more moderate party be pleaſed with their attendance; yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers indiſcreet, are inflamed with their new deſires; and will not ſpare to make unjuſt vows, to haſten a birth to their expectations.

And would they that I ſhould commit my ſelf to a condition more hatefull then death? to be at diſſention with my own Sonne, whom I love more then mine own life? Should I expoſe my ſelf to the danger of a War, where the victory and the defeat would prove equally <hi>funeste,</hi> and

direfull to me? Where if I were conquered I muſt be vanquiſhed by a <hi>Paricide?</hi> Or if I ſhould prove the Conquerour, ſhould be conſtrain'd to ſacrifice mine own Sonne as an Oblation to the Empire? And ſo blot out the high crime of <hi>Treaſon</hi> with blood flowing from mine own veins? No, no, <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> follow not the ſame Maximes, if <hi>Herod</hi> cauſed his children to die, I love rather to cauſe mine to Reign: And as the innocency of <hi>Philip</hi> is like to that of thoſe young <hi>Princes,</hi> I have been willing to provide that hee ſhould not bee able to loſe it. To this end, that I might preſerve my ſelf from imitating that unfortunate Polititian, I beleeve that few Princes will copy out my example, as I have had much difficulty to find out any to imitate of former Ages. However Poſterity will commend my deſign, when they ſhall underſtand how much my Sonne hath merited; I having done a thing ſo extraordinary. And I wiſh, with all my heart, that <hi>Philip</hi> may have children ſo wiſe and hopefull, that hee may doe for them, as I am about to doe for him, and that he may voluntarily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render his Empire without any conſtraint at all.</p>
               <p>All theſe reaſons (honoured Siſters) are (as ſeemes to me) forcible enough to oblige me to act as I have done. Yet (if without oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vanity I ſhall diſcover the ſecret of my ſoul) I vow to you I am in part ſtript from the Empire by a deep ſence of Piety, and Devotion to Religion: For why? the reſt of my life paſt hath been mixed in the Tumults of Armies, and with Managerie of War, where he who is ſtiled <hi>Dominus exercituum</hi> hath not been ſo adored as he ought. And I cannot but know that hee (from whom all their puiſſance ſprings) will demand an exact account of their Adminiſtration: And that they who have judged Nations and People, ſhall (at laſt) be judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Yes (Siſters) as I know how the ambition of <hi>Francis,</hi> and mine have troubled all <hi>Europe,</hi> and interrupted the repoſe of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;</hi> I fear, that this ardent deſire of Renown, which hath ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated us both, will not prove a cauſe and ground ſufficient and lawfull before the undoubted <hi>Tribunal</hi> of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD: Seeing then, <hi>that the wiſdome of men is but fooliſhneſs before him,</hi> their vanity can be no other then criminal abhomination. <hi>I tell you, I have a fearfull ſence of the blood of ſo many Souldiers ſlain, of the outcries of ſo many people ruined, and of the flames of ſo many Towns burned, lest they ſhould mount to the Throne of Heaven, and there cry for vengeance against me.</hi> But if that be true (which we muſt not doubt, ſince Truth it ſelf ſpeaks it) <hi>that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous fall ſeven times a day, how often offendeth he who is not juſt at all?</hi> This reflection (my dear Siſters) hath cauſed me to look on Scepters, Crowns, Kingdomes, and Empires, as common obſtacles of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and made me reſolve to loſe them, to find out means to ſave my Soul. An old Captaine of mine one day entreating my Paſſe, and <hi>Congè,</hi> told me that one ought to have ſome ſpace and time betwixt the affairs of this life, and the day of death. This piercing word ſtroke ſo deeply within my <hi>Soul, that it can never be blotted out:</hi> And ſince that fortunate hour, wherein that ſage Captain admoniſhed me, even to this inſtant, I have imitated his prudence; nor hath that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Memento</hi> ſlipt out of my memory. No (virtuous Ladies) it was not in a rude Tumult that I concluded this Grand action; I examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a hundred times before I undertook it; and after that, I ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my own blindneſs to the inſpirations of Heaven. Yet if beſides
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96822:14"/>
this ſo juſt cauſe of my Retreat, I may be permitted to adde another reaſon, which ſhall be the laſt end of my diſcourſe: I vow freely, that the death of <hi>Francis the firſt,</hi> ſeemed to ſay to <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> that it was high time for him to ceaſe to live, or at leaſt, longer to Reign; in effect it were not juſt that this great perſon ſhould enjoy repoſe in his Tombe, and that I ſhould continue ſtill in trouble: Seeing that our travelis are alike, it is fit (in ſome reſpect) that our recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ſhould be proportionable; and as ſome illuſtrious Perſons buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him when he was dead, I am content (in ſome ſort) to bury my ſelfe alive. All the Earth cannot now afford an Enemy worthy of <hi>Charles,</hi> after the death of <hi>Francis,</hi> and the youth of <hi>Henry</hi> hath not the proportion of years to that age, to which I am reduced, he ought firſt to have made <hi>three hundred Sieges,</hi> and gained more then <hi>twenty Battailes,</hi> before he be fit to enter the Liſts equally with me: It were not juſt to expoſe lightly the Glory of an old Captain to the fortune of a young Souldier; I have too much to loſe, and I ſee too little to gain, to prevent me from a game ſo hazardous, and I ſhould not have leſſe Teſtimony of imprudence then of courage. If I ſhould longer be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly confident, the Seige of <hi>Metz</hi> hath cleared mine eyes, and makes me ſee perſpicuouſly that fortune, like Ladies, loves to court beautifull youth. Let not then men think it ſtrange, if I retire my ſelf from her ſervice, and commend my Son to her favour. In a word, <hi>Charles</hi> oppoſed <hi>Francis</hi> as long as he lived, and I leave <hi>Philip</hi> to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with <hi>Henry</hi> as long as he Reignes. It ſhall ſuffice for my renown, that I leave off to Reign then, when I have moſt abſolute power, and hence all the World ſhall be in an amaze; ſhall diſpute and doubt, which Act ſhall be more glorious, either to have Reigned ſo ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly, or acquitted the Empire ſo freely. Seeing therefore that the Empires of the chiefeſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> were not more glorious then that of mine, it is fit that having excelled all others, I ſhould at laſt conquer my ſelf, quitting my Ambition with my Crowns, and Scepters, and ſo with this new kind of Victory obtain an unheard-of glory, which all poſterity ſhall not equallize, but with much difficulty. Let us go on then (moſt incomparable Ladies) let us go on to honour the Trees of my deſart, and ſtore my Wilderneſſe of retirement, with the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and glorious Trophies of ſo many Nations; and we will make the whole Earth confeſſe, that he that had power to quit ſo many Crowns and Scepters, was not unworthy to wear them.</p>

(if I durſt ſay it) to his puſillanimity, His own Son (and ſo <hi>Strada</hi> doth aſſure us) could not abſtain from a gallant and ingenious Raillery, for when one told him he had the hap of a good year when the <hi>Emperour</hi> his father ſurrendred his <hi>Crown,</hi> he replyed that his Father <hi>might have</hi> another when to repent it. This ſentence was a certain prognoſtick of the humor of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond. And theſe different diſcourſes of the Father and Son, makes it evident to the World that <hi>Philip</hi> would not appear of the temper of <hi>Charles;</hi> And that it ſhould never be ſaid of him, that antiquity related of a Noble <hi>Grecian,</hi> that, <hi>Tydides was better then his Father.</hi> This ſubtle and cunning Polititian reſolved not to be ſo kind to <hi>Philip the third</hi> as his Father had been to him; who through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of age, and the Gout, and the thoughts of death, conceived himſelfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſurrender a <hi>Scepter</hi> he bad born ſo long. Our <hi>Lewis the eleventh,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a Maxime and reſolution of this Nature; who, as long as he could retain his ſoul within his body, held faſt all the markes of Royalty with Soveraign Power. It is true that he commended them (at the laſt moment of his death) to his Son, but he ſent them in ſuch a faſhion, as a man may eaſily believe the Act was rather to taſt his inclination, then to oblige his Son, and rather to diſcover the <hi>Daulphins</hi> reſentment, then to expreſſe his own paternall tenderneſſe. A man may ſay that this Prince ſeemed to have a long time to live, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to prolong his Reign, he uſed all endeavours to cauſe his miſeries to dye, that men might know that he was yet alive, he fortified the Caſtles of <hi>Pleſſis,</hi> and <hi>Tours</hi> rather againſt death then any other Enemy; he experienced the choiceſt and rareſt remedies to renew Old Age, and cure his Conſumption: And if his Chriſtianity had not ſweetned the Asperity of Policie, it may be well beleeved, that he would have ordained when he was a dying, what once a great Polititian appointed, that he would have ſhowers of tears run plentifully at his Funerals, thereby (if it were poſſible) to cauſe the living to reſent his power when he was in the grave. And now, conſidering all the precedent Affairs, I may be juſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to honour, and commend a <hi>Spaniard</hi> (if a Prince born in <hi>Flanders</hi> may bear that name) and dare venture to ſay, the action of the <hi>Emperour CHARLES the fifth,</hi> was Grand, Glorious, truly Noble, and Heroick: For he freely parted with that which the loſſe and ruin <hi>of ten bloody Battels could not force him to.</hi> He underſtood (at laſt) the vanities of thoſe Grandeures which he had ſo much courted; and deprived Fortune of all power of robbing him of any thing, and as his Motto was, <hi>Plus ultra,</hi> ſo he concluded he had ſomething to endeavour beyond his <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>earthy Kingdomes</hi> to look after: This great ſoul found out (at laſt) that the whole Earth was but as a point, or prick in compariſon of Heaven: Without doubt the <hi>bleſſed Spirit which guides the hearts of Kings</hi> (and ſo a great King tells us) infuſed this generous Reſolution. And though this Action have no example but that of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> (whom the Primitive Chriſtians permitted not to be ranged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt good Princes, yet we may confeſſe and avow, it was a ſublime, and high Act, worthy of greateſt admiration, and moſt worthy of thoſe happy times, when men ſaid, <hi>Philoſophi ſunt Reges, &amp; Reges Philoſophantur.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it is not leſſe rare to ſee a King become an humble Hermite, then to ſee a poor Gardiner advanced to be a King, as <hi>Abdolominus</hi> was, whom <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> commanded to be crowned. Now as it is rare and admirable to ſee one ſurrender, and quit a Crown, as <hi>CHARLES the fifth,</hi> ſo it is no leſſe to be admired to ſee one aſſume, and take it up, as one of our Kings did, who was <hi>LEWIS the fourth.</hi> His Father was dead in <hi>priſon,</hi> his Subjects in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> and (at the ſame time) he an <hi>Exile</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but the ſucceſſe of time changed the fate of all affairs, and ſtrock a deep ſenſe into the <hi>Rebels</hi>

I know well, that this diſcourſe will ſurpriſe you, and that you did not beleeve when you preſented mee with a Scepter, that I ſhould not rather have received it with Thanks, then Reprehenſions; but this act is extraordinary in its commencement, in its progreſs, and in its concluſion; and it is juſt that all circumſtances ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable.

They owe them their goods, their lives, and their liberties; and their Princes owe them nothing but Juſtice, which can hardly pardon Traitors.</hi> If theſe Truths, and Maximes had been equally underſtood, and followed by the late King my Soveraign, and you his People, affaires had not been in that ſad condition as they now are. The State had not been reduc'd to ſuch confuſion; the Provinces had not been Cantonized; <hi>Germanie</hi> had not been ſo full of Factions; <hi>Italy</hi> had not been ſo divided; all the Cities of the kingdom had not had ſo many Kings as they now have Governors; you had not been guilty of the crime of Treaſon, in elevating an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper to the Throne, the King my Father might ſtill have Reigned, or (at leaſt) I might have received the Crown from his hands, and not from yours; his Tomb might have been bedewed with my tears, his Scepter had not been prophaned, his Hearſe might have been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Trophies, and not with Chains. And (to ſpeak all in a few words) you might have been <hi>happy and innocent.</hi> But as his <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> and your <hi>Rebellion</hi> were the ſole cauſers of all theſe evils, ſo your <hi>Obedience,</hi> and my <hi>Justice,</hi> are the onely means to make reparation.

Firſt, you have violated all ſorts of Rights in the perſon of your King, you have raiſed a Warre againſt him, you have aſſaulted him, and afterwards poyſoned him; you have abuſed the confidence he had in you, you have detained him priſoner with as great <hi>Treaſon</hi> as <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> with as great <hi>inſolencie</hi> as <hi>cruelty:</hi> an <hi>injury</hi> which was never offered (hardly) to the perſon of an ordinary <hi>Herald.</hi> Thus you have violated, and impudently abuſed your <hi>King;</hi> you have detained him priſoner during a Treaty of Peace, for five years together led him from priſon to priſon; you have forced him not onely to ſet by his <hi>Militia,</hi> and to depoſe his Crown; but you have conſtrain'd him with violence to transferre it into other hands then mine. To conclude; you put him to death, and you have reduced my ſelf to a ſtrict neceſſity, to ſearch my ſafety in my flight, and to goe and ſhew my miſery beyond the Seas. Yet this is not all, you have done one thing which never any did before; it hath been ſeen ſometimes that the <hi>Grandees</hi> of a Kingdom have interpoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt a <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> and have deſtroyed it; but 'twas never ſeen that they themſelves elevated a <hi>Tyrant</hi> to the Throne as <hi>you</hi> have done: In theſe kind of crimes the Abettors may be ſaid to be more criminall then he who hath received all the fruit: For if each one of you in particular had aſpired to ſet the Crown upon his own head, you might have been more excuſable, then to have ſnatcht it from your <hi>lawfull Prince</hi> to place it on the head of an <hi>Uſurper.</hi> But you'll ſay to me, <hi>the Prince that bore it was not able to ſuppert it.</hi> To that I ſhall anſwer, As I have the honour to be his Son, and was his Subject, it belongeth not to me to determine what he <hi>could,</hi> or what he <hi>could not:</hi> ſeeing hee was my <hi>Father,</hi> I ought not to preſume to be his judge, and ſeeing hee was my King, I ought not to be ſo impudent to cenſure, much leſſe to condemn his actions; he being not obliged to render an account to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>But God alone.</hi> Believe then, the ſame reſpect I have for his memory, you ought to have had for his perſon, he was your King as well as mine: ſeeing then that <hi>Kings' are called the Fathers of the People;</hi> Their Subjects are obliged to have for them a true reſentment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which their very birth may infuſe into them; Bſiedes as <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Do you not diſcern the contrary, how in theſe occurrences they redouble their vowes &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and that they are never more obedient to God, then at ſuch a time, as if God had forſaken his providence of the Univerſe? and when it ſhall ſo happen, that Heaven (for the puniſhment of your ſinns) gives you a Prince under whoſe Reign <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> are not well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, during whoſe Government Forraign and Civill Warrs devour all with cruell ravages; it belongeth not then to you to reprehend and condemn your Soveraign; for, is he feeble? then you ought to ſuſtain

him: is he unfortunate? you ought to bemoane him: is he wicked? you ought to looke upon him as a ſcourge and chaſtiſement ſent from Heaven, and to waite with Patience for a remedy from that hand, which hath cauſed your evill. For when a Prince commands an Army, and gives Battail; if it ſo happen that the Souldiers perform not their devoires and duty, that his ſquadrons yeild, the main body be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and (in the end) after he hath done even miracles in his perſon, he be yet conſtrained to quit the field, and to retreat from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that bears the loſſe and infamie of the day? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that by his own particular actions he hath merited to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror? ſeeing it is thus, why will not you (in ſuch conjunctions) bear with the infirmities, and misfortunes of your Princes, as well as they do with yours? Or (to ſpeak ſomething yet nearer to the quick) who do you not repair theſe diſorders by your own more exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? The Prince alone is obvious in a Battail to the infamy, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe and misfortnue of his whole Army, and you are thouſands, who are obliged to ſtrengthen the Authority and Honour of your King-which he cannot ſupport with his ſingle valour. Believe me, <hi>if all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would be loyall, no Kingdome could be miſerable:</hi> and <hi>if all Princes thought more of ſeverity then of clemency, there would not be ſo many Subjects Rebells.</hi> Moreover if it were permitted to the Capritious people to take and give Crowns, when they fancied a change; I conceive there is not a Shepheard but might hope to be a King, and not a King but might be reduced to be a Shepheard; ſo unruly and uncertain are their float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgements. But (to ſpeak the truth to you) theſe things ought not thus to paſs: we are your <hi>Maſters,</hi> and you ought not to become <hi>ours.</hi> It is not that I am ignorant that <hi>God diſpoſeth of Scepters and Crowns, as he pleaſeth, and gives them as he liſteth, and beſtowes them on, or takes them from whom he will, and what he alwaies doth is without all injuſtice; ſometimes permitting that the people ſhall elevate to the Throne, theſe who never pretended to ſuch a high degree. But when ſuch an accident happeneth, it is uſually in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to thoſe extraordinary perſons in whom Virtue hath impreſt a Royall Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſo viſible, that it were almoſt injuſtice not to admit them Kings.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that which precedes, and that which followes, ought to be ſufficient to juſtifie the effect, and it became <hi>Charles Martel, Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charlemain</hi> puiſſantly to erect a Throne, which was not founded upon a line of right ſucceſſion, yet even in this reencounter you well ſee the event to this preſent hath not authorized your deſign. The Engine of of this enterprize, hath been ſlain in battail; The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rhemes</hi> preſerved not his life, but three daies after he had anointed the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But it is not ſeaſonable (to day) to exaggerate the injuſtice of your proceedings; I am not willing to particularize other things, and I ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf with telling you, in generall, that <hi>Kings ought not to loſe their Crownes, but with their lives, and that nothing can diſpenſe Subjects from the reſpect, and loyallty, which they owe to their Soveraigns, nor any pretenſe (Whatſoever) Authorize Treaſon and Rebellion. If ſacred perſons</hi> may notenjoy their particular priviledge, <hi>(which is derived from none but God)</hi> they ſhallbe expoſed, more then others, to all ſorts of miſeries; Their guards will appear to them inſtead of Enemies, their Thrones will rather ſeem a direfull precipice then a place of honour,

and ſafety; a <hi>King (of this kind)</hi> is no better then an <hi>illuſtrious ſlave,</hi> when he ſhall have as many Maſters as Subjects. This firſt diſorder will quickly cauſe a ſecond, for, when the <hi>Nobles</hi> of a Kingdome faile in their duty to their <hi>Prince,</hi> their own <hi>Vaſſalls,</hi> and <hi>Tenants</hi> will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their feality to them, and then <hi>Rebellion</hi> communicated from the <hi>Grandees</hi> to the <hi>Commons,</hi> and ſo deſcending from one Soul to another, an univerſall confuſion ſwells and devours all. <hi>Every one will command, and no perſon obey,</hi> and (in this reſentment of <hi>Levelling equality) each perſon proves a ſlave to his own ambition, and no one, either rationally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands himſelfe or others.</hi> In effect, this is the moſt ſad condition that a Kingdome can fall into, when there is no ſubjection, and where (for their puniſhment) the Prince hath not force to reduce the people to their obedience. For mine own part, when I conſider my ſelf to be the Sonne of a King, the ſucceſſour of ſo many Kings, and yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that I immediately ſucceed not my Father; This Idea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints in me, a ſtrange confuſion as towards you, and an extreame grief as towards my ſelf; for when I reflect how the ſame Subjects who inchained <hi>Charles in Fetters,</hi> and gave the Crown to <hi>Robert,</hi> placed <hi>Lewis</hi> on the Throne, the malice which they bore to the Father, may it not eaſily fall upon the Son? and may not they fear that the Son will revenge the outrages committed againſt the Father? but yet (may ſomeone ſay,) thoſe who have ſearcht after you, and paſſed the Seas to preſent you with a Scepter, they need not fear that the memory of their antient injuſtice will oblige you to puniſh them; They have reaſon rather to believe, that this laſt ſubmiſſion ſhould blot out the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the firſt diſſervice: It is certain, <hi>in the exact Rule of iuſtice, no Noble Action ought to paſſe without his recompence:</hi> and it is really as true; <hi>That no Crime ought to eſcape without his puniſhment.</hi> After all theſe reaſons, what ought you not to fear? and what not to hope? you have recalled me to the Throne, tis true, but if you had not, had you not been as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall againſt <hi>Lewis,</hi> as you had been againſt <hi>Charles?</hi> he who gives to another, that which he hath taken from him, reſtores without doubt that which he hath taken, but his reſtoration is not a free preſent, &amp; he ought not to expect thanks for an Action of that nature. No, it ſufficeth if one puniſh not the firſt, without intending any recompence for the ſecond. I may ſay alſo, that you underſtand not rightly all my preſent concernments; for why? becauſe you have not left me ſtill in exile, becauſe you have rendred what juſtly appertained to me, Becauſe you underſtood that I came to re-demand mine own, not with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Army; and (being tyred with your crimes and miſeries) you believe you may probably diſarm the fury of Heaven, by this Act of juſtice; No, no, confide not in any of theſe pretenſes, for if I had not ſtronger conſiderations then theſe, I ſhould commence my Reign with the puniſhment of your treaſons, I ſhould ſend them to priſon, who reſtrained the perſon of my Father, and expoſe them to the moſt cruell tortures, who contrived and cauſed his death, with the greatneſſe of his misfortunes. Thoſe black crimes are ſuch which nothing can exterminate; <hi>Repentance and teares for common errours, where humane frailty may plead excuſe, and not for Traitors and Rebells, nor for thoſe, who have deſtroyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No, I ſcorn a Throne where I ſhould be a ſlave, and I had rather be obſcured in Priſon, as my Father was, then not to Reign as Soveraign. <hi>Thoſe people with whom Loyalty is elective, forbear not to make their Kings abſolute, becauſe they could have no pretence of Juſtice to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:</hi> Judg then, if thoſe who hold their Crowns from Heaven ought to acknowledge their ſubjects for their Maſters, and whether they ought not rather to Puniſh, or Pardon, as beſt agreeth with their pleaſure. In a word, <hi>I find it far more glorious to be a loyall Subject, then to be a King diſobeyed.</hi> Prepare then your ſelves to render mee all that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which you owe me, and (without farther informing you whether you are to hope more for Clemencie or Juſtice) reſolve your ſelves to an abſolute ſubmiſſion. I know well ſome peeviſh Polititians will cenſure, that I act not as I ought in this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and that I ſhould reflect on former paſſages with ſome ſweetneſſe, and gratifie you with Preſents, to encourage you with future hopes, but I preſume my Policie is more generous, and more ſecure then theirs; for if I had ſo perſwaded you, perhaps you would have beleeved me to have been more fit to wear my Fathers <hi>Irons</hi> then his <hi>Crown;</hi> and would have more ſuſpected me of weakneſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation; this exceſſive indulgence would give you more of fear, and me leſſe of honour and eſtimation: I (being then ſo far from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſuch Maximes) tell you once more, that I declare my ſelf to be your King. And (without farther capitulation with you) I aſcend the Throne by the ſteps of mine own Authority as Soveraignly, as if not recalled by you at all. Hitherto I have let you know I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how far the duty of Subjects ought to bend: But moreover I judge it fit to acquaint you to what degree Soveraign Clemencie may extend it ſelf; to this end, that by that reſentment, you may reaſonably know what to fear and what to hope. Know then, that <hi>although a Prince may juſtly puniſh Traitors, he may likewiſe pardon penitent offendors, principally then, when he diſcernes his pardon ſhall reclaime inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to obedience, and fidelity:</hi> For, ſeeing Kings are the Fathers of the people, they ought not alwaies to be too ſevere in Juſtice; and <hi>ſeeing that a Prince may afford grace and pardon to his enemies, he may without doubt ſhew pitty and mercie to his own Subjects:</hi> He cannot well puniſh them all, but muſt (in part) enfeeble himſelf; nor ſluce out their blood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out emptying his own veins; wherefore he ought to ſpare them as far as Reaſon and Juſtice can make the way paſſable. When then a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular accident grows up againſt a Prince, or State, it may ſuffice that the heads of ſome chief offendors be ſacrificed to a reparation, and that by ſome ſevere examples others may be inſtructed with exampla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie terrour. But ſeeing that the number of the offendors may prove infinite, and if all ſhould be puniſht, a deſolation of entire Provinces might ſucceed, and conſequently more men be loſt then 15 main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails could devour, ſo that the piles of dead corps ſhould make moun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tains, and ſevere execution of revenge cauſe Rivers of blood: In ſuch conſiderations (I ſay) it may be better to uſe a greater example of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, then of Juſtice, and hazard ſomething, rather then to loſe the lives of ſo many miſerable ſoules; and <hi>there cannot be a greater Victory then to vanquiſh ones own Paſſion</hi> in ſuch dangerous conjunctures. Fear not then that I ſhall abuſe my Authority, ſince if I ſhould puniſh all who have offended, I ſhould reduce my Kingdome to a forlorne Deſart:

For who is there among you that hath not failed of his duty? Some have done miſchief, others have deſired it, or at leaſt permitted it to be acted; ſome have aſſiſted <hi>Robert,</hi> others have directly fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their King; ſome have moſt perfidiouſly laid their hands upon their <hi>Anointed Lord,</hi> &amp; committed a <hi>ſacred perſon</hi> into Priſon; and others have (at leaſt) forſaken him. <hi>The publique good is the pretext of all things, but Rebellion alone is the Mother of that horrid Monſter.</hi> The Nobles agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated (as they did) for their own intereſt, and the people by their madneſſe, and unadviſedneſſe, ſeconded their fury, and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the intentions of the Paricides: Your Wives and your Children are not exempt from theſe crimes, ſeeing (without doubt) they made vowes for their Parents offending, and prayers againſt their Prince. Whereas then I cannot puniſh you all, but that I muſt utterly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate you; it reſteth at my choice, whether I would become a King without Subjects, or to pardon you out of pure grace and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not by Obligation. It may be that during your lives you may repent you of your ancient crimes, and become as faithful as you have been diſobedient. But (perhaps you will tell mee) as to our ſelves, we have repented formerly before wee ſent to you to come, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Scepter which belongs to you. 'Tis true, it may bee as you have ſaid, and that I have conſidered your Addreſſes to mee were to make reparation of what formerly paſſed, and that with thoſe hands you would advance to the Throne his Son whoſe Father you had bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly removed. But (after all) <hi>whoſoever can abandon the path of Virtue to make choice of that of Vice, can again embrace that occaſion if preſented.</hi> Wherefore you owe greater obligation to me then I can confidence to you; for had I not reſolved to ſhew Grace and Pardon, the great number of Nobles which the King of <hi>England,</hi> my Unckle, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me to attend my perſon, had not come without Souldiers; each one of theſe who incircle me have Troopes at their command; and I would not have received my Fathers Crown but in the head of a victorious Army, in the midſt of a Field covered with dead, and dying men, bedewed with the blood of ten thouſand Rebels; I would have been the Conqueror of my Kingdome, and not have mounted unto the Throne ſupported by the ſame hands who ſnatcht it from my Fathers head. But I call to mind I am your King, as you are alſo my Subjects, and in this relation I can love you yet, as guilty as you are; I can have pitty for your errors, and kindneſſe for your obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and I will not put my ſelf into a condition of ſadneſſe after the Victory: I am then come to you without an Army, to receive what is mine. This Action (without doubt) is hardy, bold, and wel deſerveth glory; and is ſufficiently obliging to demerit your acknowledgement in all degrees of fidelity. Before that you were criminous, the Divine and humane right conjured you not to forſake your Prince; but this day a new obligation chaineth you to more ſtrict obedience. It is not enough alone to be faithfull, ſo to ſatisfie your dutie; but it is your part to blot out the memory of what is paſt, and to juſtifie what is preſent; you ought not to look on me meerly as your King, but as a King of your own choice, as a King who hath pardoned you, as a King who conſideth in you, who now is commending his perſon into your hands, and commits the very care of his life to your protection, next to Heaven: Study then to gratifie ſuch preſſing endearments, and

They pretend much to deſire your preſence, but their feares exceed their deſires: And it is rather to ſecure your perſon, then to advance your Scepter; that though you are this day recalled, yet as long as your youth continued, they ſuffered you to live in exile, and obeyd <hi>Robert;</hi> but he being dead (at preſent) and they ſeeing that you were in a condition to obtain by force that which they now offer, they ſeeme to repent, not ſo much regarding your loſſe, as themſelves. Behold the reaſons which have here conteſted with my reſolution, which (ſeeing they are not without ſome rationall ground) I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to perſwade my ſelfe, and in that double choice, whether to make a War with you, or confide in you, I have choſe the latter as more glorious, and <hi>I love rather to hazard my perſon then the deſtruction of all my Kingdomes.</hi> Thoſe who taught me the art to Reign, have well foreſeen the Exigencies to which I am now reduced, and therefore without doubt they took ſo much care to adviſe me what I ought to doe in juſtice, and what I might be allowed to do in Clemency; Theſe two Vertues appear as contraries, but are not; they accord eaſily in the heart of a Prince. They mutually give place each one to the other in the Empire of his Soul, according to the divers occaſions which are preſented, for he ought alwaies to abound in Clemency, and he ought not likewiſe to be ever too ſevere with the ſtrict meaſure of juſtice. <hi>Mercy and juſtice are two excellent Virtues, but prudence ought to imploy them both: And the Princes ſole Will, ought to be the onely rule to guide them.</hi> Having then conjured you to an equall confidence in me, as I have in you, let an Act of oblivion paſs, and <hi>let us remember no more former crimes, unleſſe it be to prevent relapſes.</hi> Let us not look on the Tombe of <hi>Charles,</hi> but meerly to bedew it with the teares of tender repentance: Not to make it an Altar whereupon to ſacrifice his Enemies; let us Raze to the ground thoſe horrid Cells which ſerved for his impriſonment, thereby (if poſſible) to deſtroy the memory, and not to leave a mark or point to poſterity of thoſe black crimes; let us aſcend the Throne with as much ſplendor as if it had never been prophaned, and let us Reigne (if poſſible) with more honour and tranquillity then the late King my Soveraign did. But do not think I ſhall be able to effect it without the aid and ſuccours of my Subjects; deceive not your ſelves, <hi>the valour and prudence of the Prince are not ſufficient of themſelves to make a Kingdome happy:</hi> The Subjects ought to contribute their proportions.

                     <hi>The Cenſure on</hi> LEWIS <hi>the Fourth.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Doubt not but many will cenſure that in this diſcourſe I have confounded two great Virtues, and that I have miſtaken generoſity for prudence. Others will conclude this Action of our <hi>LEWIS</hi> the fourth, as ſavouring more of the fierceneſſe and impetuoſity of youth, then of the Sage and orderly conduct of a skillfull polititian. And they may ſeem to ſpeak truly (if their examination of the paſſages be onely ſuperficiall and ſlight) and the Objection appear equitable; And then (conſequently) that I could not handſomly range this illuſtrious Prince amongſt thoſe who have exactly followed the Precepts and Rules of true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, which is the Miſtriſs that guideth Royall affairs with leaſt danger. What State-prudence (will ſome Polititian object) counſelled this young Monarch to ſpeak to his Subjects ſo high, when he was ſo low? and having ſcarſe got well on horſeback, thus to ſalute his Subjects, who had their Arms in their hands? Rebels, Subjects, who had lately tumbled his Father from the Throne; who had torne the Crown from off his ſacred head, changed his Scepter into Chaines, and his Palace into a Priſon? might not this bold entrance to the Throne have rather provoked them to deſperation then obedience? and raiſed a new tempeſt which could not be appeaſed, without much difficulty? might not this noiſe have ſerved to awaken them to freſh jealouſies and feares, which their own prudence ſhould have taught them? Certainly this objection (at firſt view) ſeemes invincible, that <hi>Lewis</hi> did not appear ſo diſcreet and judicious as his condition required: And that I was little leſs, who preſumed to ranke and reckon this Frince amongſt thoſe, who had exactly learned the Art of Reigning over a Kingdome. Notwithſtanding, he failed not in his Kingly craft, and (if my reaſon deceive me not) I am not guily of any miſtake in this deciſion; for whoſoever ſhall examine this great Action from the bottome, and weigh the Arguments maturely, will be convinced of this opinion, and neither condemn my judgment, nor the Reſolution of <hi>Lewis</hi> in this eminent Action. The Counſells of Prudence prove different according to ſeveral conjunctures of occaſions, and ought to change their countenances according to the preſent diverſities, and important alterations of affairs. And, as hardy and bold reſolutions are not alwaies ſeaſonable, ſo neither are timorous and fearfull proceedings ever wiſe and ſafe; That Polititian who trembles, and is not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; who dares do nothing generouſly and ſtoutly for fear he may prove too raſh &amp; inconſiderate, ſhall be ſeldome fortunate; he is too ſpeculative a Contemplator, and proves rarely quick &amp; active. And whiles he amuſeth himſelf with curious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations whether he ſhould, or ſhould not undertake the enterprize, whether he ſhould ſpeak or be ſilent, be an induſtrious actor, or a dull flegmatique Spectator; The opportunity (by this time) may be well loſt, the Starrs change their ſcituations, Aſpects alter, and ſo the fatal moment whereon depended the good or ill ſucceſſe of a grand deſign ſlip clean away without advantage. That Philoſopher (whom ſome cenſured as over-wiſe) found that his tedious doating on too much conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration brought forth no fruit, but folly; and that his moſt ſubtile concluſions,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96822:20"/>
were no better than fancies and dreams of one newly awaked out of ſleep. The Augurs telling an old Captain that the Pullets would not eat; he quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the myſtery, and anſwered, If they would not eat except they drank, they ſhould have their fill, and ſo caus'd them to be flung into the Sea; at which ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he gave battail to his Enemies &amp; gain'd the day. An old Souldier told his General, the Enemies were twentytimes more then they; but he replyed gallantly; And for how many doſt then account me? Another told his Generall that the Enemie darted Arrowes like ſhowres of Haile; he replyed inſtantly, tis ſo much the better for us, we ſhall fight against empty quivers, and but ſhadowes of men. The Policy of high borne Heroes, and low hearted Peaſants is not the ſame. The Mariners diſpute in one faſhion aboard their Ships, and the Commanders and Souldiers after another in their Trenches. And as theſe perſons are very diſtinct, and different in their qualities, ſo are they in their Counſels, and Agitations. Thoſe who walk on dangerous Precipices, ought to march boldly, if they intend to paſſe ſecurely. And in thoſe Attempts, he who ſtaies to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the depth of perill in his way, either will prove ſo fearfull as not to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or elſe will be in great danger of a ruinous fall. To judge then of the Action of <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth, a man ought to conſider what this Prince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderated, how his Fathers gentleneſſe and civility was his ruin: That he ſpoke to the ſame Rebels who had raviſht his Fathers Crown from his head, and depriv'd his perſon of his liberty: And that by the ſame capricious humour they recall'd the Son who had deſtroy'd the Father; and leſt that might ranckle and ſwell again, and ſo infect and deſtroy the Sonne as it had the Father, it concern'd him then to let them know, that he came now to inherit his Fathers Kingdom, and not his infirmities: That though firſt impreſſions may exchange, or obliterate ill humours, yet it is with great hazard and difficulty. Wherefore it was more important to his purpoſe to strike deeper at the rootat firſt, to gain better advantages. If <hi>Lewis</hi> his feet had been ſeen to tremble when he was to aſcend the throne, he muſt then have diſcovered a capacity to fall again. If he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the crown with a dull and phlegmatick deportment, he had been rather made a King by his Lords and Maſters then his Subjects; and he would have unfolded to his People the paſſion of cowardly fear, rather then have procured due regard from them. We may conclude then, that this Prince was wiſe, in being ſtout and gallant in this occaſion; that his Policie was not indiſcreet, and (co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with Souldiers, and men of Armes and Valour) his diſcourſe was not improper, as containing nothing that might give the ſhock to Soveraign pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but rather on the contrary what well became the Grandeur, and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of a King. Yet perhaps ſome will ſay unto me, ſuch harſh and rigorous proceedings have not alwayes had the beſt ſucceſſe; if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had well obſerved the predictions of his death, if he had better regarded his words, who anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, That the Ides of <hi>March</hi> could not paſſe, and were not yet come: If he had read the Note preſented to him as he entered into the Senate, it is to be preſumed he had not been ſtabbed. If the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> inſtead of an haugty reply to what he found under his Napkin, had speedily taken poſt, and fled from <hi>Blois,</hi> he had not ſatisfied the States Generall with his own Ruine, nor ſigned his death at <hi>Cayere</hi> with his own blood. All this is true, I muſt needs conſeſs: But ſuppoſe it ſo happens once, it is not neceſſary that it prove ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes: And it is more perillous to be ſtupidly ſilent, then to diſcourſe heroickly, for ſuch reaſons chiefly which I formerly mentioned. He declared his courage, and his conſtancie: And <hi>Lewis</hi> did nothing in this conjuncture but what well became a truly noble, and wiſe Prince. Nor did this glorious action relliſh of any thing but what beſeemed an Illuſtrious <hi>Hero,</hi> and a prudent <hi>Politician:</hi>

And it might have ſo fallen out, that all Chriſtendome had been in hazard and danger to have been ſwallowed up, if the bounty and favour of God, (which much exceeded the horrour of your crime) provoked with jealouſie for the defence of his own Altars, for his own Glory, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the name of Chriſtian had not raiſed up the invincible <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niades</hi> my Soveraign King and Father.

For the firſt; What appearance was there, that a people, Friends to <hi>Europe,</hi> a people civilized, and profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> could be ſo barbarous as to take pleaſure in the deſolation of our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> and the ruine of our <hi>Towns?</hi> in the prophaning of our <hi>Temples?</hi> the defeates of our <hi>Armies?</hi> and the murthering of our Souldiers? What? was prey and Pillage, Fire and ſword, teares and blood, wounds and death, pleaſant Objects for your diverſions? Could you take delight in ugly and extravagant pleaſure? in things capable to ſtrike horror and pitty in the moſt inſenſible Soules? the Mountaines of men ſlaine, and the Earth covered with wounded bodies, old men pulled by their beards and hair, and ſtabbed before their Children, Infants ſnatcht from their mothers pappes, and daſhed againſt the walles, and mothers dragged by the hair, and ſo piercing the Heavens with their hideous cryes; Virgins miſerably expoſed to the inſolency of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and the bloud of grand and brave Kings powred out to the laſt drop, The <hi>howſes of God diſhonoured,</hi> his <hi>Prieſts murthered, his</hi>

                  <hi>Altars</hi> defaced, and all thoſe ſacred things in the hands of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and ſacrilegious <hi>Turks?</hi> Could all this, and ſuch like objects, yeeld you any pleaſure, and content? and could you look on all this miſery, not onely with a dry eye, but with an eye ambitious of ſuch crueltie? as pleaſed with ſuch horrid objects, and deigning ſuch miſeries no compaſſion? Do not men ſpeak of <hi>Nero</hi> as a Monſter of Nature, and ſhame of Mankinde, who could looke on <hi>Rome</hi> on Fire without regret and grief? You have ſeen a Kingdom on Fire without the leaſt touch of Compaſſion. And ſhall not you paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cenſure of Monſters, as not worthy to behold the light, and fit to loſe that bleſſing with as much grief as ignominy? Judge your ſelves, did ever <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſee their fellow <hi>Chriſtians</hi> periſh and moulder into crums under the <hi>Infidels</hi> Swords and Simeters, and become ſo perfectly inhumane, as to rejoyce at their deſolation? Did the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> when they ſtormed the walls of the <hi>Leſtrigoes,</hi> and the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and (as it were) eat thoſe Men-eaters (or at leaſt ſaw them torne, and rent in pieces) find any content in ſuch objects of miſery which they were forced to make? No, no, as barbarous as you have been, and as extreamly rigorous as we judge you, we ſhall not beleeve that men, that <hi>Vene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe that are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of committing ſuch grand offences, cannot but think they may receive ayd from others, and their innocency makes them judge of others by themſelves; nothing being able to incline their judgements contrary to thoſe naturall inclinations upon which they are founded; we cannot beleeve then that it was <hi>jucundum quid,</hi> a delectable object which you propoſed in refuſing your aſſiſtance, and ſo expoſing us to the <hi>barbarous Mahometans;</hi> it being farre from all appearance that you ſhould conceive a thought, or finde any pleaſantneſſe in things ſo contrary to humanity, and directly oppoſite to all that may pretend to give any joyfull content or pleaſant ſatisfaction.

Thoſe who have moſt ſeriouſly examined the conſiſtance of the true glory of <hi>Princes,</hi> having diſcuſſed the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo many ſeverall waies, and well obſerved the biaſſes of different intereſts, have all agreed in this, that it conſiſts principally in this Maxime, <hi>To protect the more feeble, and to reſiſt the more puiſſant.</hi> Yea it is in this alone, wherein conſiſts true generoſitie. It is in this diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted virtue, wherein Princes do finde their greateſt ſplendor. It is this unſpotted reputation which they ought to endeavour all their life. A beam of true honour, and which they ought to prefer above that of their <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Crown.</hi> In effect, all their other actions (how glorious and beautifull ſoever they appear in the eyes of the world) may meet with an ill conſtruction, and without this receive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious interpretation. <hi>Conquerors</hi> may be deemed to be ambitious, <hi>Peacemakers</hi> may be cenſured to be timid, ſevere <hi>Princes</hi> paſſe for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, <hi>Clement</hi> may be ſuſpected to be feeble, <hi>Liberal</hi> accuſed to be prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls, <hi>Provident</hi> accounted covetous, <hi>Valiant</hi> ſtiled raſh, and the <hi>Prudent</hi>

lazie. The Majeſty of Princes may be cenſured Pride, their Facility Baſeneſſe: If they are too grave, the people will not love them: If too familiar, their Subjects ſcorn them; If gay and glorious, they are reviled as incompaſſionate; if Melancholy, then nothing will oblige them; If Prudent, then too full of craft and ſubtilty; If Frank and Ingenious, then imprudent and indiſcreet. In a word, all their thoughts, words, and actions are ſubject to receive an evill interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the envie and malice of men. There is nothing then but the protection of the feeble (when it is offered) being free, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out private intereſt, which hath no cauſe for an Apologie: And there is nothing more truly noble then this generous reſiſtance, which (op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing over-powerfull enemies) is rewarded with generall approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And in a deſign of this nature there needs no Reaſons or Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtoes to authorize the Armies of ſuch illuſtrious Captaines. The thing ſpeaks it ſelf, each oppreſſed ſoul implores aid from heaven upon Auxiliary Troops. And their high enterpriſes are not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of any perſon, no not of their very enemies.

And if ever any <hi>Senate</hi> found favourable opportunity, that of yours might have ſeaſonably afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us protection which we ſo earneſtly demanded, and you ſo cruelly refuſed: We were weak, our Enemies were puiſſant; they were the <hi>Invaders,</hi> we the <hi>Defenders</hi> of our Rights; they would have uſurped our Kingdome, we ſtrove to defend our Country; they had no right in their pretenſions, and we no injuſtice in our Defence: What ſhall I ſay more? They were <hi>Turks,</hi> and wee <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> they were ancient and naturall <hi>Enemies,</hi> we your <hi>Friends, Allies,</hi> and <hi>Brothers:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all (as I ſaid before) they were ſtrong and puiſſant, we weake and feeble; which argument was ſufficient to have obtained your Protection, if you had been truly Noble, and had aſpired to true glory. And what honour could you ever have obtained ſo great as that? to have oppoſed and ſuppreſſed vigorouſly this torrent, and to have extinguiſhed the violence of Fire and Sword, which came to ravage <hi>two Empires,</hi> and <hi>ten Kingdomes?</hi> What a glory would it have been to you to have arreſted their Force, and to have got Victories from that Monſter who overthrew the Throne of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, and extinguiſhed the Race of the noble <hi>Paleologus?</hi> What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation had you not gained in revenging new <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of theſe Barbars? and what eſtimation had you not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſupport of our weak condition againſt ſo great an Enemy? To oppoſe thoſe that doe evill, and to defend thoſe which ſuffer, is a Leſſon which Nature it ſelf inſpires, and is taught without a Tutor.

                  <hi>impoſſible to thoſe who are nobly born, not to range themſelves on the weaker ſide, and not to oppoſe the unjuſt Violence of oppreſſors.</hi> A naturall inſtinct preſſeth us, compaſſion forceth us, reaſon leadeth us, and (as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in our ſelves) ſuch an Action of incompaſſion would ſeeme very rude. And humanity directeth us, that we could not endure that ignobleneſſe in an other. Certainly they are not men, but cold ſtatues, and ſuch as the frozen hearted <hi>Venetians,</hi> who ſtand ſtill in ſuch a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter without motion and action: They deſerve not the names of men, who can be inſenſible in ſuch conjunctures; and he ſeemes not a rationall ſoul, nor ſcarce a meer <hi>Animal,</hi> but a ſenſeleſſe ſtone, who can refuſe ſuccour to the oppreſſed when they implore, and are in neceſſity. If it be a ſhame to refuſe aſſiſtance when men are implored, and not to oppoſe the injuſtice of them who oppreſſe; how much more ſhamefull is it then, not onely to ſee the feeble periſh, not onely to deny them ſuccours, not onely to reſiſt their violence, who devour them, but rather to ſtrengthen the oppreſſours, and (cowardly) to joyne themſelves to them who were too ſtrong alone? Oh <hi>(Venetians)</hi> there hath been too much of baſeneſſe and inhumanity in theſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proceedings: and this action hath been very black and fowle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of as little honour and honeſty as delight and pleaſure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to have engaged you in ſuch an enterprize; which being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapable to render you any glory, will eternally cover you with the Clouds of <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>infamie.</hi> For if you were our Enemies, why did you not publiquely declare and tell us, as the <hi>Turks</hi> did? and if you were our Friends, why did you joyn with the <hi>Barbars,</hi> and ſo aide them to ruine us? No, No, true honour was not the object of ſo baſe and black an Action, nor could true content or ſatisfaction be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an enterprize ſo bloudy and cruell. Seeing then that your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings were neither founded on that which may be rightly judged <hi>Jucundum</hi> or <hi>Honeſtum,</hi> let us ſee if <hi>Utile,</hi> profit, and avarice hath obliged you to a cowardly acquitting of your <hi>Allies.</hi> When that Maxime proves true which is ever falſe: That <hi>Kings, Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Republicks,</hi> ought not abſolutely to conſider any thing but the repoſe of their own eſtates, and their particular utility: When (I ſay) naturall equity, civill ſociety, the Alliances of <hi>Crowns,</hi> the Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Religions,</hi> Common intereſt, Glory and Honor, ſhall be valued as things indifferent: Yet you ſhall not finde really the <hi>Utile</hi> you may pretend to in this unworthy Action, wherein you appeared. Is there any one who knowes the principles of <hi>Policy,</hi> and of that art which teacheth <hi>Kinges</hi> to raigne? and underſtands not, that a powerfull neighbour is ever terrible? That it is very advantagious, that Seas and Mountaines ſeparate their eſtates from ours; To that end, That both the one and the other may be as bounds to reſiſt their avarice and ambition? and if a Prince leſſe powerfull then he, both in reſpect of the numbers of his Subjects, and in the extent of his Dominions, lye in the way as a guard to our Frontires, and be ſcituate in the midſt of two Potentates as an eternall obſtacle to the unjuſt <hi>Uſurpation</hi> both of the one and the other; is there not a clearer poſſibility of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?

As the ſole marke of their enterprizes, and object of their Armies, who in their Conqueſts regard not the auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of their Victory? and thoſe whoſe ambition is inſatiable, finde all too little to ſatisfie themſelves, having no thoughts of contenting others? Who knowes not that avarice as well as ambition, and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, arries on the <hi>Turkes</hi> with a predominant inclination? that that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never acts by any other Principle? And who can be ignorant, but that your new Allies will (at length) leave you in the lurch? On the the other ſide, In the Condition wherein <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> then were, might not <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond eaſily diſcern that you joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your forces unto him out of a particular intereſt; And therein ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſought your own ſafety then his glory? That you left us, to preſerve your ſelves? And that you begged his amity, to avoid his wrath? that baſe feares made your progreſſe, and not true Friendſhip or love? That (in truth, and purely) you onely regarded your owne advantage, and therefore made a ſhamefull alliance, with one, whom you as much hated as feared? What Obligation can be ſtronge in a matter of this nature? and what reaſon have you to hope for any thing under the pretence of ſuch a favour? Moreover, when he ſhall obſerve how cruelly you have forſaken (and that in extremity) your antient Allies, your neighbours, and your brethren, connected to you by the Ligaments of the ſame Religion, Lawes and Manners, what aſſurance can you fancy that <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall have in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, having ſeen you violate ſuch ſacred obligations? And what

credit ſhall he give unto your words, having known you ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to forfeit your Faith? We may adde yet, if that which ratifieth treaties, renders alliances aſſured, and peace durable, is, That, treaties, Alliances, and Peaces, are equally advantagious to Kings, Soveraigns, Princes or Republicks, Who make them becauſe that equality is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and reciprocall advantages oblige the one and the other to an exact obſervation of the Articles concluded betwixt them; What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion then of equality can there be between the Republick of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and the Vaſt Empire of <hi>Turkie?</hi> What advantage can the <hi>Turks</hi> receive from your feeble Troops, who is a Conqueror attended with ſo many Millions of Souldiers? what profit think you to gain from him who ſwallowes Scepters and Crownes as little morſells? Who depopulates more Kingdomes and Empires then you have Townes in your Dominions? Whoſe formidable Armies cover the largeſt Campanies, and traverſing the mighty Plaines, drink up whole Rivers where they are encamped? Is not this your alliance as the oblation of a ſhallow Brook to the Ocean, when you joyne your ſlender Troopes to his mighty Armies? and is not this a ſignall error, to dream that your handfull of Forces ſhould be conſiderable amongſt ſuch infinite numbers?

Have you never heard them call the Chriſtians, <hi>Jaours,</hi> that is, Doggs? and from that injury raiſe an argument, and conſequently conclude that they are not obliged to keeep their words with doggs? Do they not barbarouſly breake Faith and promiſes with thoſe of their own Nation, as well as with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? How perfidious was <hi>Baiazet,</hi> who, after the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſent to ſeek for <hi>Soloman</hi> his elder Brother, upon pretence of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have him Crowned; And having abuſed the facility of that Prince, cauſed him inhumanely to be ſtrangled, and ſo introduced a barbarous example into the Family of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> which hath been but too often imitated ſince that horrid precedent? <hi>Orchan</hi> the ſecond, Emperour of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> feigned an argreement with ſome Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> thereby more eaſily to delude ſome others; And after he had devoured his firſt Contractors, with leſſe difficulty deſtroyed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers according to the Stratagems of his own devices.

But united into one great body, they compoſe and make up an Ocean which may terrifie the boldeſt adventurers. You may conclude, that if Chriſtian Princes and Republiques held a Faithfull Correſpondency and firme Union, both the one and the other might without doubt reſiſt the Turkiſh Power, and ſtop the progreſſe of his dangerous Conqueſts, with great facility: But when we ſee the Chriſtians themſelves divided, this potent Enemy may with more eaſe deſtroy them all, ſingling out each Kingdome or Republick apart. Oh, you <hi>Venetians,</hi> none of theſe juſt conſiderations have prevailed to perſwade you, being tranſported with the Violence of particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. The preſent condition of affaires was more Prevalent with you then to admit a Praeviſion of future dangers: and your Caecity was ſo great, that you have deſperately caſt your ſelves into an Abyſſe; thinking thereby to avoide a precipice. Obſerve then the juſtice of God upon the heads of the offenders. They (on the grounds of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood &amp; imprudence) Contriving vainly to preſerve themſelves from one perill, have caſt themſelves headlong into another; Their impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous craft ſeducing them to deceive others, deluded themſelves. Their ſubtile policy ſeemed to teach them perfectly the art of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when the events diſcover'd the errors of their maximes. It is true then (as the Scripture witneſſeth) <hi>that God inſatuateth the wicked in their own deſignes, and diſperſeth them as a Clowd, and cauſeth them to Vaniſh as ſmoake.</hi> By all that I have ſaid, it appears thereby, that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum, Honeſtum,</hi> and <hi>Utile,</hi> were not the arguments which perſwaded you to this Savage action. I may rightly conclude then, that by a meer inclination to an evill end, you were willing to deſtroy us, and have found a Malignant rejoycing in our ſorrowes without the Knowledge of that wherein conſiſts true joy. Why was this evill undertaken by you; Unleſſe you had been borne to do no good? But ſeeing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is not ſufficient for rationall men, who act not as beaſts, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon and election of what they voluntarily chooſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually inclined to good or evill, vice, or Virtue: Are not we in a juſt expectation of a Viciſſitude, and Change; that Vindicative Juſtice may recompence all your evills? We well underſtand that Martiall Lawes admit Letters of Reprizall; the moſt rigorous of the moraliſts, allow us to reſiſt Invaders, to defend us from their Violence, and to repell their Forces; And if the Law of God ordained <hi>an eye for an eye, and life for life</hi> in the puniſhment of Crimes, ought not we imitate your ſelves, ſeeing the day is changed, and affaires have a better preſence? May not we now go and contract an alliance with <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and refuſe to aid you, who denyed ſuccours firſt to us? Might not we joyn our Forces with his, giving him aſſiſtance with our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells and Souldiers, whereby we might impower him to ravage your Frontiers, defeat your Armies, ſtorme your ſtrongeſt Townes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave your Generalls, chaſe you not onely from the main Continent, but even from all the Iſles you hold in the <hi>Archipelagus?</hi> This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Conjuncture may afford us an obligation to mix our Colours with his enſignes, and ſo magnanimouſly march againſt that ſuperbe Town, and thoſe aſpiring Ramparts which obumbrate the Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Sea, and command imperially all the adjacent ſhores.

And when a favourable occaſion is preſented of ſweet revenge: That paſſion tempteth a moderate ſoul, and ſhaketh the affections of the beſt temper.</hi> And if the means of revenge be ſo uncertain, and rare to be found, it is more incomparably dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to refuſe the occaſion when it freely offer it ſelf. It is in this rencounter when the Spaniard makes that prayer, <hi>Guarda me Dios de mi,</hi> God defend me from my ſelf. <hi>And it is truly neceſſary; for if a ſoul be not guarded with the ſhield of Virtue: It muſt (without doubt) yeeld in ſuch a dangerous combat.</hi> And if any particular obſtacles prove more violent: How outragious then are the paſſions of <hi>Princes!</hi> And thoſe who fancy to themſelves, that they can will nothing but what they ought? And when able to act what they will, being in power, are not they moſt apt to deſtroy and ruinate thoſe who have provoked them? To reſtraine then the Thunderbolt from falling on the heads of the offendors, is ſomething Divine, or (at leaſt) above ordinary humane power. <hi>Execution belongs to the Hangman; but grace and pardon to the Gods.</hi> And certainly the <hi>Theorie</hi> of this ſcience is more facile then the <hi>Practice.</hi> Princes ſeldome forget (in ſuch affaires) that Juſtice is divided into two parts; and that part which is called Vindicative, is no whit leſſe equitable then that other, becauſe it ſeems leſſe humane. Thoſe who ſay <hi>they would puniſh if they were not in choler, are as rare as the Phoenix;</hi> and Hiſtory (in generall) makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more of the one, then the other; that is, it ſpeaks little or nothing but of the firſt: For it is very difficult for the ſame perſon to be mild, and mighty; to be able to puniſh, and yet to pardon; to be in a capacity to revenge, and yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to relieve: It is very difficult, inſtead of deſtroying of an Enemy, to ſtudy, and adventure for his preſervation. From all theſe arguments wee rightly underſtand how perfectly that Prince was accompliſhed, how great his Virtue,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96822:28"/>
how magnificent his Generoſity, of whom we have ſpoken. Doubtleſs he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not only the Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> but likewiſe the Morals of Chriſtianitie, which (without all exception) are the moſt excellent and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Foundations. He well knew that the King of Kings is called <hi>the God of Vengeance,</hi> who reſerves that puniſhment (primely) to himſelf, <hi>as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely capable to render it without paſſion, and to puniſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intereſt.</hi> He underſtood that the ſight of his Enemies, proſtrate at his feet, was far more glorious then to ſee them in their Graves; and to lock on them weeping with their eyes, then weltring in their blood. That to have a power to revenge is as equally ſatisfactory as revenge it ſelf. Certainly with what ever eye we view this grand action, we muſt conclude, that it was very Glorious; which was not as the Painters Art, who by optical deluſions, change the face of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſities of ſeverall Viewes. But on the contrary which way ſoever wee look, this action was <hi>ſemper eadem,</hi> and moſt admirable: Yet if wee look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the exact rules of Policie (without any conſideration to the Maxims of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) according to thoſe Principles, who doubts not, but that this Prince did ill, and that his Progreſſe herein, was more generous then prudent?

Not conſidering how much his active ſoul contributes towards your quiet, nor his care to your repoſe.</hi> Think not that the <hi>ſacred Character</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> (which diſtinguiſheth them from their Vaſſals) conſiſteth meerly in the magnificence of their <hi>attendance,</hi> the puiſſance of their <hi>Armies,</hi> and in the riches of their <hi>Treaſures.</hi> No, it is not all this that compleateth the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> nor doe theſe royal occurrences onely command your <hi>obedience,</hi> and make <hi>Kings to raign. But it is an honour and obedience ſeated in the very foundations of your ſoules, in which garb you ought to approach to their throne with adoration. And you are bound to beleeve (as toward yourſelves) that your Prince cannot erre as towards his vaſſals.</hi> This may teach you not to intermeddle with his actions, not to reſiſt his Government, not to demand or Peace, or Warre, to will what he liketh, and to believe that his pleaſure is not unjuſt. <hi>It is upon this Baſis of Loyalty and obedience that the foundation of Majeſty is built;</hi> and whereby it is ſolely preſerved: Who ever failes in this originall duty may eaſily fail in all others.

But (perhaps you will ſay to me) our Complaints, our Murmurs, our Cryes have rowſed your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour from being longer lull'd and charmed with the imbraces of love: And that you have not onely quitted the object of your paſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and removed it, but likewiſe ſacrificed that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that you ſhould forſake: at leaſt we have gained this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that we have our deſires and more then we expected. To all this I reply, that I have done as much as you ſay, but do you withall know the reaſon of this proceeding? <hi>It is to teach you with ſome terror, never to preſume to cenſure any Actions again:</hi> For (I lye not) in this Conjecture you have moſt deceived your ſelves, you believed that love had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the thoughts of honour from my heart; That the wanton plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of peace had robbed me of the deſires of Glory in Warre; And that I had been ſo accuſtomed to proſtrate my will to the beauty of a fair ſlave, that I had forgotten the art to Command and rule men; And when I lead the Damſell to the Scaffold, you (doubtleſſe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I aſcended thither to make an Apologie as Captivated intirely by that fair Lady, and ſlain by the darts of her beautifull eyes. But underſtand once more, <hi>You are too low and ignorant to be my judges, and that it belongs to me to be yours.</hi> I doubt not but that you will (with much difficulty) digeſt the ſtrangneſſe of this accident, and that now you acknowledge your ſelves not to be my Judges, but witneſſes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Action which I have done in your preſence. Some may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in their thoughts to account this as barbarous, others will ſay that the fair bloud which I have ſpilt, will blemiſh the brightneſſe of mine honor: Some will conclude that by this Action I have gained more then by a Battail; And in others let thoughts be free. <hi>If I be not deceived, they dare not ſpeak but what pleaſeth me, or elſe they do but whiſper</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:96822:31"/>
                  <hi>very low.</hi> This example is high enough to ſtrike a terrour into thoſe who have vapoured of their owne inſolencie in murmuring againſt mee, and to perſwade all Kings, that <hi>It is better policie to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves formidable, and to live more in their Subjects fear, then in their love.</hi> But if any one ſhall object, the ſeverity of Juſtice is ſpeedily trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into Cruelty: I anſwer; <hi>It is much better to think too little, then too much of Clemencie.</hi> I confeſſe, <hi>Cruelty may make the Subjects miſerable, but Clemencie may make them criminall: A ſevere Prince baniſheth Vice from his Eſtate: When the indulgent doth tollerate and authorize it, and makes it his uſuall recompence.</hi> It were better then that Subjects ſhould complaine of their <hi>Princes,</hi> then that they ſhould bee forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of their <hi>Subjects.</hi> Murmur then (you Vaſſals) at my ſeverity if you have cauſe. In the reſolution I am in, <hi>your accuſation will rather prove an honour then an injurie.</hi> I have been ſevere to my ſelf in taking away her life who was the chiefeſt ſatisfaction to my owne. And I doe not thinke that any Age (heretofore) can preſent us ſo rare an example. It is now our pleaſure to reſolve you that the <hi>Charmes of love, and the thoughts of honour lodge not in my breast at the ſame inſtant;</hi> Concluding the repoſe of our preſent eſtate to be rendred more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by ſo ſtrange a precedent. If I had admitted this fair <hi>Greek</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me in a <hi>March,</hi> and that her dalliances had ſeparated mee from the Councels and dangers of Warre, then you might have murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If I had lockt her within my <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the Jealouſies of my <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanaes</hi> might have attempted her perſon, and your hands revenged their Jealouſie. And if you had been her Executioners, I had ſtill juſtified my ſelf as <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Conquerour</hi> of what I poſſeſſe, though ſhe were deſtroyed. But rather ſee this inevitable Fate and Tragedy acted by my ſelfe in perſon. I did beleeve it farre better that ſhee ſhould fall by ſuch an illuſtrious hand, then to expoſe her (whom my ſoul ſo loved) to your prophane rudeneſſe. And as we read of ſome Fathers who have ſacrificed their own children gloriouſly for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their Country, I may do the like, and cauſe my Miſtris to dye for my glory, and the Intereſt of mine own <hi>Empire,</hi> without ſuſpition of fear or ignominy. This act is nothing elſe but the cutting off the thread of her life, not the ſhortning of mine; the deſtroying of her beauty, not of my ſelf; the cloſing up the ſplendour of her eyes, not the obſcuring of mine own; and though I be robbed of her for ever, yet am I not deprived of the variety of other pleaſures. Now as <hi>Kings live not onely to themſelves, but must render an account of their actions, not to their ſubjects, but to their Posterity, and Kings their Succeſſors,</hi> (I hope) in ſacrificing this object of my love, I have ſufficiently teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>all things ought to ſubmit to true honour and renown:</hi> That this ſole intereſt ought to ſuperſede all others: And that no other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſhould bee able to interpoſe in a ſoul truly Heroick. To bend towards the concluſion, <hi>A Prince who acts not with a noble reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above all others, is not worthy of the quality of that high condition: And whoſoever refuſeth an occaſion (fitly offered) merits not to have it.</hi> It is by ſo fair a temptation wherein you were ſo fouly criminous, that I omitted not to liſten to your murmurings. Having then ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly commenced a Warre againſt my ſelfe, it becomes me to continue it againſt mine enemies with an equall valour; and it is your duty to repair your crime by their defeat; and ſo to merit your lives (which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96822:32"/>
I give you) by taking away theirs, by pouring out their bloud for ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of yours; and that you expiate a pittiful death with an illuſtrious Victory. Pardon <hi>(ſairſlave)</hi> him who hath pardoned thine Enemies, our of meer conſideration to his honour: I have been an Infidell to true renown for love of thee. I have abandoned the deſign of new Conqueſts, not revenged the hatred of mine Enemies, and retarded the deſire of Victory: But this imperious Miſtreſſe of Heroick ſoules (whoſe Domination is ſo abſolute) could not ſuffer thee longer to be her Rivall. She demands from me my heart intirely, and I have not power to reſiſt her: She hath poſſeſſed me from my infancy, and ſhe will enjoy me to my end: I have forſaken thee, (tis true) but tis for that, <hi>for which</hi> Alexander, <hi>the</hi> Caeſars, <hi>and all Princely Heroes of Antiquity have ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Know (Souldiers) that I cauſed not this fair <hi>Lady</hi> to dye, but as I found her a Cloud and Obſtacle to the ſplendor of my name. Look to it then, that your Cowardice Eclips not the beams of my honour: For if ſuch an accident ſhall arrive, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be able to preſerve you from my indignation, nor from the moſt exquiſite puniſhments. I ſhall then recompence two horrid Crimes at one time; Conſider then, and be not leſſe hardy with your hands, then you have been ſawcy with your tongues. I know well (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ordinary Cuſtome) inſtead of threatning you, I ſhould gently intreat you to the Warrs, and ſuffer your affronts: But in this Conjuncture my Prudence is more fit and uſefull. For if you ſhall prove Cowards, my Enemies will puniſh you more ſeverely then if you dyed in the Battail. And if you are brave Spirits, and gain the Field, you may expiate your Crimes, and obtain your Pardon. <hi>When one perſon offends, he is to be puniſhed (without diſpate) to terrifie others from being Malefactors; but when Multitudes become criminous, it is wiſdome to draw advantage from their ſtrength, rather then to exterminate their perſons. Thoſe who have taken the boldneſſe to rebell againſt their Prince being Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly commanded, may prove stout and Valiant againſt his Enemies when there is a power above them to force their endeavours.</hi> Come then (Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) come I pray let us march and fight. But as I have engaged in the word of your Emperour, I will fight with as much reſolution as any private Souldier, and expoſe my ſelf to equall danger. I ſhall pretend that you beat the Enemy, and whileſt I gain the Victory, you ſhall raiſe new Trophies to our <hi>Crown.</hi> Such a ſucceſſe may redeem your Crimes from the Guilt of innocent bloud which you have ſpilt, and recover you to that Innocency which you have loſt: Such an act may appeaſe the rage of your diſpleaſed <hi>Prince,</hi> and diſcharge you from

that Odium, Infamie and Tortures, which your black Rebellion hath contracted upon you.

But the wrath of the ſecond was the deſtroying Thunderbolt. <hi>The firſt motions of the ſouls and haſty raſh words ſlip often from us inconſiderately, and yet are notranked in the number of mortall ſinns:</hi> No not by the moſt ſevere and ſtricteſt Caſuiſts. It is confeſſed, that <hi>a good man may have wicked thoughts, and yet thoſe (quickly dying) grow not up to the ſhape of ſinns; though their Conceptions be abominable, yet in a ſecond reflection the ſoul diſliking them, and the will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſuch ſinfull Cogitations, it may be fairly granted that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts, and raſh words ſuddainly repented, are very pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There is no imagination ſo pure which our fantaſies can preſent, but conceived in a tumult, as well have their pardon as imperfection:</hi> But within a ſoul, which radically preſerves Innocency, abortive Cogitations vaniſh away as Clouds: They are as the Creatures <hi>Ephemeroy,</hi> which dye the ſame day they are born: Or yet if they have any being, it is ſo exiguous, that it is ſcarce viſible. But as for this Action of this <hi>Monſter Mahomet,</hi> it was not of that nature; He compleated his Vilany by acting what he had thought, and ſpoke: Circumſtancing his Cruelty, with deiberation, making no uſe of time to repent or return from what he intended. What his imagination conceived, his underſtanding examined, and his will approved as good: Commanding his hand to commit the Crime, which that member could not have acted, but by the impetuous pleaſure of the will. It was his diſordered ambition that transformed the <hi>Emperour</hi> to become the <hi>Executioner;</hi> Love was not then the predominant paſſion, he ſubmitted his ſoule to another affection more powerfull and Tyrannick; And the fear of expoſing his authority to a hazard, ſupplyed him with courage to perpetrate that which I am hardly able to leave in Hiſtory; So highly doth this Action (in my judgement) deſerve to be concluded Barbarous and unnaturall. <hi>Policy is a moſt neceſſary guide to Government; And it is then beſt, when regulated by the Maxims of Religion, whoſe ſacred direction permits not power to tranſgreſſe beyond the bounds of reaſon, truth and equity:</hi> Otherwiſe Policy is but like a keen ſword in the hand of a furious Mad-man. The thoughts of a wiſe man (where Religion is wanting) grow up into horrid Crimes. And that which <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Legiſlators</hi> propoſe as an univerſall good, turnes to evill, and proves a plague and puniſhment to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96822:33"/>
particular perſons. This Prince (of whom we have ſpoken) (if one ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſerve ſo noble a name) cauſed it to be written upon his Tomb, <hi>That his deſign was to ruin</hi> Rhodes, <hi>and ſtately</hi> Italy. Let us not admire then, if one who deſigned that his ambition ſhould live on his Sepulcher when he was dead, stuck not to take away that life which he feared might bee an obstacle to his fatall ambition. Such proceedings as theſe are much like to thoſe of angry Lions, who uſually ſtrangle them whom they moſt careſſe and court. Thoſe then whom ſuch Tyrants love, ought to fear: for it is a queſtion not eaſily decided, whether their love or hatred carry greater danger.</p>
                  <p>Now from this act of horror let us turne our eyes to a spectacle worthy of Compaſſion, and from this ugly Monſter (who diſſembled Reluctancie upon the Scaffold) let us contemplate upon a King of better merit, and ſo divert our thoughts with more relations of varieties.</p>

Seeing then that ſome ſhadow of good appears mixt with that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and his ſlight crime relliſhed of ſome tincture of Virtue, and that Clemencie is a Royall quality as well as Juſtice, towards which the dictate of my naturall inclination is very pliable: I have reſolved to pardon him, upon condition nevertheleſſe; That <hi>you (Duke of Nagera,</hi> who in this caſe appear more juſt then either he or I, by detaining him priſoner, at the inſtant when he was culpable) ſhall make him know at his deliverance, that he hath at leaſt merited a perpetuall impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment: That a hundred actions which a noble Spirit (as hee was) might effect, can never countervail his failings: And that if I did not as well call to mind that I am the Father of my Subjects as their King, I ſhould in his perſon imprint ſuch a bloudy and ſignall mark of my anger and diſpleaſure, that all others who are inconſiderate ſhould be terrified by his example, and become more wiſe, declaring to poſterity, that I never conſented to a thing ſo unworthy the Grandeur and Majeſty of Kings. If this offendor (Noble Duke) had endeavoured to breed diviſion in the breaſts of <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and to ſow diſſention and diſorder in the Royall Family; if he had withdrawn my Subjects from their duty, raiſed Forces in our Provinces, and armed my people againſt me: I ſhall ſay yet further, had he held intelligence with the King of <hi>Granada,</hi> whom he abuſed, and had falſly ſold him more Towns then hecheated him of by his treachery; had he filled our whole Kingdome with blood, horrour, and confuſion, (I ſhall yet mount a degree higher) If he had attemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted the life of my Children, my Queen, and ſelf, he had leſſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, and had been more pardonable then for that crime which I mention here: For in thoſe affairs he had onely troubled my repoſe,

and ſhaken my power, but had not obſcured my glory, or ſtained my reputation. I ſhould have eſteemed him unfortunate, but not ſo criminous; hee ſhould have appeared mine Enemie, not my Confident. But hee offended with greater dishonour then in all theſe Circumſtances: And if I had both loſt my Crown and my life, my honour ſhould have been ſtill entertained (dearer to me then both) which he hazarded to ruine.

But it cannot be ſaid ſo of publick Faith, of <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> and naturall equity; Theſe are things that are univerſally reverenced of all people and all Countries: And by Conſequence, thoſe who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them cannot expect but to be deteſted of all men in generall. If I ſhould then have approved the odious Action of <hi>Corrall,</hi> my Faith, my Word, my Integrity may come to be ſlighted, or at leaſt ſuſpected by all the Princes of the Earth. Which of my Allyes, in Leagues of peace might not fear my perfidious underminings? And which of my Enemies (during Warre) would give Faith to my Paroll, or affie in my Treaties? My moſt genuine and freeſt proceedings would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the ſuſpition of treachery and deceit; they would look upon my promiſes &amp; engagements as baites to allure their Credulity; and liſten to my propoſitions as Fables and lies: They would credit that all my diſcourſe compriſed under it a ſecret and malitious ſence, they would ſtrictly examine all my words, ſcorne every particular ſyllable, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an exact and rigorous diſcuſſion of my thoughts, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they cannot be aſſured of any thing they pretend to; And

for fear of expoſing the grandeur and ſecurity of their eſtates to the hazard of Falſhood, they would reſolve to trouble me eternally. All perſons are either my ſuperiours, more powerfull then I, or my equals, or my inferiours: And amongſt theſe three orders of men, not only my neighbors, but all Princes of the Univerſe are comprehended: And it is undoubtedly true that the firſt wil reſolve certainly rather to oppreſſe me, then injudiciouſly to expoſe themſelves to perill, and to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated by me. In the choice of acting or ſuffering In juſtice, there are but few generous men that will chooſe the latter way. And <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the purity of Chriſtianity hath left us a precept of perfection, yet there are but few Chriſtians, and rarely any Prince who is perſwaded to obey that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall truth, and to follow (upon any occaſion) ſuch diſintereſted Counſels.</hi> To ſpeak then the truth of things (as they ought) there is no Prince who could, or ought to believe, if I had committed ſuch infidelity, that my ruin had not been very neceſſary; or (for a generall good) who would not think it a brave action to endeavour all his power to haſted my fatall moment? As for the ſecond rank, of thoſe who are equall in power with me, their perpetuall obſervations of my infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity howerly arming them, will never ſuffer mee to be in any repoſe, nor make any League or accord with mee. The leaſt alteration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Subjects and mine will ſpeedily bee made a matter of State: The leaſt diſorder which ſhall ariſe in the Commerce of Trade will be interpreted as an injury to the Soveraign: The leaſt Banke which ſhall be in diſpute towards the Frontiers betwixt particulars, will Alarum all the Country into Commotions, as if I incroached upon their Provinces. And (in concluſion) it will fall out, that the hazard of a Battaile may decide the differences, and that the good fortune of the Victorious, or ill of the Vanquiſhed may bring ruine to both parties, and ſo calme their inquietudes, and all their miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. For the laſt ſort, which are the weakeſt, though they appear moſt contemptible, they oftentimes prove moſt formidable. For as they know themſelves to be in danger to loſe all, ſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves more cunningly crafty to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the oppreſſion they feare, or miſdoubt: Hereupon they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſow the ſeeds of diſcord and diviſion amongſt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of an unfortunate Prince whom they fear; they incite the Male-contents, and quicken their capricious humours; they complain and murmur with ſeditious ſpirits, and intereſt them to their party for mutuall aſſiſtance of each other: Then they decry the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, reproaching the Prince, as unjuſt and tyrannicall, and ſo ſtruggle to ſhake off the yoak of their obedience, and abandon his protection. And if Princes bee too ſtrong for theſe factious Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feus, then they gather, and aſſemble in Conventicles; firſt whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their miſchief in ſecret, and after breake out into open Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and Rebellions: In the end theſe unquiet, and turbulent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, (hurried away with giddy apprehenſions) redouble their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall activity; and having a ſpecious pretence for their enterprize, never ceaſe, but change and tumble untill they reduce all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confuſion and diſorder. And having runne into that extremitie, ingender (at length) ſuch groſſe clouds and opinions upon the Prince, that hee is judged criminall; and outrages daily encreaſing, the rude multitudes, like Thunder-claps, and Lightenings, threaten
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96822:35"/>
a terrible deſolation. It is in vaine in ſuch an unfortunate conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of evils to expect any ſuccours from Neighbours; who (if not profeſſed Enemies) rather become Newters then Parties, or Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. This perfidiouſneſs ſtrikes as well an <hi>odium,</hi> as a horror to all who obſerve it, and gaineth pitty from no perſon: Nay, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which ſcarce procureth attention, much leſſe compaſſion to the ſaddeſt complaints; and the moſt ſcrupulous perſons ſeeme ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, being ſpectators of the diſgraces of a faithleſſe Prince: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving themſelves to merit reſpects, if they augment not their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and diſhonour. This is not all, but how great ſoever their miſeries bee in a viſible apparance, the acts of Injuſtice prepare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exquiſite and certain evils. <hi>Princes are ordinarily the rules of their Subjects actions: And are as the</hi> Primum mobile <hi>to all their motions: Their great examples are imitated, and followed by the people; each one ſees, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and ſtrives to follow their Prince as their guide; Complacency commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth this imitation, and a ſubmiſsive habitude doth continue it. If the Prince be virtuous, the people are of that inclination: If wicked, and vitious, the Subjects are apt Scholars to ſuch a bad leſſon.</hi> And as the <hi>Throne</hi> is highly elevated above ordinary ranks and degrees, ſo are the Princes errors leaſt concealed, and (by conſequence) the people ſpeedily learn to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate them, or ſtudy revenge againſt him. If it bee ſo, then what fidelity or confidence can that Prince have in his Subjects, who wanteth fidelity himſelfe? Will not ſuch a faithleſſe Governour, who failes to regard his own word, teach his people the ſame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? And <hi>will the people beleeve that Rebellion can be a greater ſinne in them, then falſeneſs can be in their Prince? Doth he think that by teaching of them that the Laws of Nations are not ſacred and inviolable, he doth not likewiſe teach the way of diſhonour, and diſloyalty to Princes? Doth he beleeve (abuſing the equity of Nature her ſelf) that the people can have any reſpect for his injuſtice?

When none of theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents ſhall arrive, our neighbour Princes ſhall live without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Subjects without revolt, as having nothing to feare on earth, and ſhall ſtand in dread of nothing but him who rules in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; their love ſhall make them loyall, and their Princes Juſtice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. Do not I know that <hi>God hateth the faithleſſe, and their infidelity? that oathes cannot be broke without a ſinne?</hi> And is not the right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (in ſome divine Relation) near to heaven? Have not I learned, that I ſhould not <hi>take the name of God in vain?</hi> And muſt we not then conclude, That in all Treaties which Princes make, their words and intentions are as common witneſſes of their Treaties; whereby they warrant and eſtabliſh engagements to each other? <hi>And ſhall not hee who is Lord of Lords, and Lord of hoſts, as he is full of power, bee eſteemed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually full of Juſtice? Can I beleeve he will approve the Injuſtice of any in the ſervice of thoſe Armies where he himſelf is General? And will authorize their perfideouſneſs (who violate their promiſes) without Revenge?</hi> Ought we not (in reaſon) not onely to fear, but to beleeve (as a thing infallible) that he will remit me to the power and fortune of mine Enemies, and hurle upon my head the <hi>vials of his wrath and indignation?</hi> And that he will (through mine own miſery) render me a ſad ſpectacle of his

juſtice for the enormitie of ſuch a Crime? Oh (my Lord <hi>Nagera)</hi> had I no other conſideration but this alone, I could not but deteſt (as I have done) the unworthy action of <hi>Corrall;</hi> and diſavow his unjuſt proceedings. Yet (it may be) <hi>Corrall</hi> may ſay (as endeavouring to diſguiſe and extenuate his fault, and in ſome kinde to paint over the Uglineſſe of his infidelity) That had he dealt with generous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who had had a ſacred reverence for their word and honour, he would have had more regard to his Faith: But knowing that (by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny experiences) the <hi>Africk</hi> of our age is the ſame with that of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and that the <hi>Punick</hi> faith (ſometimes ſo decried) is the ſame which the <hi>Moores</hi> obſerved to this day to deceive the credulity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people; Yet their <hi>fraud and falſneſſe is no example to any perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi> He could not believe himſelf to have erred in imitating them; But rather that in this he committed a high act of Juſtice in making uſe of the ſame weapon (of treachery) with which they ſo frequently (though unjuſtly) aſſayl others to puniſh themſelves. But in what School diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could <hi>Corral</hi> learn, that it was not lawfull to make choice of evill things for preſent advantages? If he who leades the way, throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf voluntarily upon a Precipe, can he oblige others to follow him? If the <hi>Moores</hi> have been perfidious, ought the <hi>Christians</hi> to be ſo too? No, no, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Evangile</hi> teach not the ſame Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> have not commended to the World the ſame precepts. Wee are not then to act according to that Doctrine, which wee deteſt as abhominable, and which wee believe to have ſprung from Hell. Theſe cowardly Actions, and infamous Treaſons, ought to have imprinted a horror in <hi>Corrall,</hi> and not to have engendred in his ſoul the imitation of a deſign ſo Criminous. He ought to have remembred that he was born in <hi>Spain,</hi> not in <hi>Morocco,</hi> and to have conſider'd that he was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and not a <hi>Moor,</hi> he ought not to have forgotten the names of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which certainly are to be diſtinguiſh't from <hi>Abindarrais</hi> and <hi>Fatime;</hi> And that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to approve an action which their Religion did condemn, and directly ſhakes the Honor, renown, and Laws of Nations, and which (though the <hi>Moores</hi> perfidiouſly admit) all <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> abhorre. To ſpeak truth, the <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> (in this conjuncture) have exchanged their Principles: Have not men ſeen the Frankneſſe and ingenuity of the King of <hi>Granada</hi> in this whole proceeding? And can any eye be ſhut at the Treaſon and perfidiouſneſſe of <hi>Corrall?</hi> I am aſtoniſhed that <hi>Corrall</hi> did not onely not bluſh at his inſolency, but that he dyed not for ſhame in the horror of his own confuſion; which he had done, had he but had ſence to conſider that all the Earth muſt know, that a <hi>Moore</hi> was <hi>ſaithfull,</hi> and that a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> had the baſeneſſe to become a <hi>Coward</hi> and a Cheat. But he hath not onely deceived the King of <hi>Granada,</hi> but <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> alſo: He had the boldneſſe, after he had abuſed the generall; (And in that Action affronted you alſo who Command our Armies in the Frontires,) to injure his Maſters as impudently; And to ingage them in his perſidious Acts and diſgracefull carriage. For when he addreſſed to me to obtain power to treat with the King of <hi>Granada,</hi> he ſpake not to me of any thing more then what your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters imported, mentioning no foul deſign at all. He onely moved that he might have leave to treat upon the Ranſome of ſome Priſoners,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96822:36"/>
and the rendition of ſome places: And I was pleaſed to inveſt him with Conditionall power, which he abuſed in deceiving that Prince. In the mean time, who could have believed a Subject ſhould have attempted ſo raſhly a matter of ſo high a nature, and without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and conſent from his Maſter? Or rather who will not doubt but that I had the unworthineſſe of Concurrence, if I had not byaſſed my Courſe another way, by diſavowing and deteſting what <hi>Corrall</hi> did? Now if we have found that men have ſlain their own Sonnes for giving battail without order (although they were victorious over their Enemies) What ſevere puniſhment hath this undiſcreet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander merited, who did not onely this action without my order, but hath committed a moſt horrid fact, which is not onely covered with Infamie, but which he baſely deſigned to obtrude on my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? (Sir) if I had in this action obſerved reaſon and juſtice, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and pitty would have found no place, and the offendor ſhould have received the wages, and recompence of his deſerts. And now who knowes whither the reſtitution which I am about to give, will ſalve the breach, and fully make reparation to mine honor? or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſterity wil judge candidly of my intentions? or rather not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them culpable? And that theſe ſecond reſolutions are but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſome remorſe or poling? and yet the glory of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> is not of ſo little Fame, but that ſome <hi>Princes</hi> out of envy would be glad to taint and obſcure it with ſo black and foul a cloud.

Frugality in a Prince may be cenſured Avarice, and a vice, which in a ſubject may be juſtly commended as a piece of prudence, and a vertue.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96822:37"/>
from their crimes. Their memory proves an execration to all the Earth: Thoſe who never knew them, live to hate them: Thoſe, whom they never offended, ſurvive to proſecute them, &amp; wil not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their aſhes to ſleep in quiet; which is a common Charity to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, dead in their graves: They are deprived from all protection, living or dead, and their Carcaſſes are inſecure, and not ſure to moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der quietly in their Tombes. Let them then who are reſolved to ſet holy Temples on fire, and commit notorious crimes, that their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Acts may be longer lived, follow the examples of <hi>Corrall,</hi> and approve, what his Conſideration undertook. But as for <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who aime at glorious immortality, and abhorre unworthy actions, they ſhall alwaies deteſt and condemn <hi>Corralls</hi> ignoble trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. And they ſhould as well condemn the offender as the crime, if his Valour did not plead for Grace for his imprudence, if Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were not a Virtue Royall as well as Juſtice, and did not (of the two) more incline to humanity. But ſeeing no Kings are ſo perfect, either in their Offices or perſons; but have cauſe to addreſſe to Heaven for pardon for many offences: They are not to refuſe others, humbly imploring favour and remiſſion, nor be inexorable for what they pray themſelves. They ought rather to apprehend by their own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties how to uſe grace and mercy towards others; And if Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their Subjects ſhould tollerate their errors and imperfections, there is a kind of a neceſſity for them to be propitious to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or at leaſt to correct but gently, ſeeing they are the Fathers of the people. That <hi>Corrall</hi> lives then, who is ſo unworthy, it is a reprive onely to render him capable to endeavour a Reparation of his Crime, by better actions, and thereby to waſh off the infamy of his perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And (in ſome degree) he may juſtifie and manifeſt to all the World the ſplendor and clearneſſe of that honor and reputation of his <hi>King</hi> which he had ſo baſely abuſed.

In all the accidents of a Kings Reigne, it ſtands with his wiſdome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and weigh thoſe things he intends to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, whether they be <hi>Just, Profitable,</hi> and <hi>Glorious;</hi> which three Conditions are very neceſſary to Royall enterprizes: and when theſe three qualities are firſt deſigned, it cannot be, but that the Cooperation of all three will be harmonious in the ſame end. <hi>Iustice and true renown render joyes full of Innocence, which voluptuous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is a ſtranger unto; and clemency in thoſe who know how to practice it as they ought, renders true delight, which revenge is ignorant of, how ſweet ſoever it may appear to the imagination.</hi> Before I can examine the reſentment of two objects ſo extreamly contrary (which is the preſent task) I muſt preſent to your memory, That a Cavalier prickt with remorſe of Conſcience, deſired to see me, and as he was dying, to diſcourſe to me a deſign which he had to kill me, and to reveal their names who had imployed him in that cruell Office, at which inſtant he could nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate no other Authors of his Crime, but mine own revolted Subjects: He ſallied out of <hi>Valladolid</hi> with others, and was not of my Camp then, when he undertook this barbarous reſolution. And it is with a well ballanced conſideration (as I ſhall ſhew in the ſequell of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) what I have here undertaken: In the mean time let the ſpectators judge whether I have not diſcreetly managed my power, being equally effective to revenge or puniſh as Wiſedom and Policy have adviſed me; or whether too much compaſſion hath not ſuborned me to Clemency, or a falſe repreſentation of Glory hath not clouded my reaſon. Firſt to conſider the Affaires in generall; it is confeſſed that <hi>Revenge is ſweet, and carries with it a Character of Divinity, and that it is the moſt terrible Mark of the Power of Soveraignes: It is by that wherewith the Subjects hearts are poſſeſſed with fear and trembling; tis revenge that bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles Neighbour Princes, and confines them within their own limits: It is ſhe that aweth the people to a continuation of peace; And (in effect) ſhe makes Kings more formidable, to all other ſorts of ſubordinate men.</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:96822:38"/>
But we muſt admit (ſometimes) of this diſtinction, that amongſt <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> it is enough to be of power to revenge thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the peace and welfare of a Kingdome; who for ſome reaſons ſometimes may better be puniſhed: But <hi>to imagine that revenge is an act permitted on all occaſions, is an erring Principle,</hi> which evill Princes have eſtabliſhed, as reſolving whom they cannot make to love, thoſe they will inforce to fear: As often as the Thunder rattles over our heads, it ſtrikes a terrour; but it falls not on all the criminous, becauſe the world is full of them: <hi>The Sunne ſhines as well on the wicked as the good: God pardoneth more often then he puniſheth; his Clemency ſpreadeth more univerſally then his Juſtice;</hi> which Attributes, though equall in perfection, are not equally and reſpectively executed on us. <hi>As for Revenge 'tis to be uſed as Phyſitians do Poyſons,</hi> (that is) <hi>in violent, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Maladies, where every other remedy will be infective, and where neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie commandeth to force and drive away one evill by another.</hi> Revenge may be ſometimes convenient, though not alwaies. The deſtroyers of <hi>Cities, Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> who to deſtroy one enemie commit thouſand innocent perſons to the miſeries of war, and care not for the prodigall effuſion of blood to ſatisfie their rage, ſurvive in Hiſtory, but in an infamous Character. The innocent bloud ſpilt dyes their crime in a deep Tincture: And (in my opinion) ſuch bloody <hi>Tyrants</hi> are not to be ranked with noble <hi>Princes.</hi> But Clemencie makes not ſo great a noiſe; She caſts a radiant beam of honour over them who practice ſo divine a Virtue: She covers their heads with a bright Ray of Splendor who are guided by her, whiles the Plotters and Actors of Revenge are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in thick clouds of darkneſſe and blood. The one engender<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth a birth of Love, the other of Hatred; the one leaves you in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, the other moves you to perturbation; the one procures you thouſands of faithfull ſervants, and the other ſtirs up millions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enemies; the one intendeth the conſolation of the miſerable, and the other is ever buſie in the invention of puniſhments. Revenge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth Fetters, Clemency conſidereth how to unlooſe them: The one practiſeth the filling of Tombs and Graves, the other is recalling to life thoſe who have merited the ſentence of Death. To conclude then rationally this point; <hi>Revenge is not to be permitted to Kings, but when it ſerves infallibly for profit or glory:</hi> And <hi>that ſecret delight which is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thoſe who ſtudy revenge (as to puniſh thoſe who have offended them) is not conſiderable in the breaſt of a noble and Chriſtian Prince. It is ſo then (if occaſion rightly offer) that if neither profit, nor glory may be obtained, that the exerciſe of revenge may be prudently ſuspended: And Juſtice</hi> (where theſe conſiderations are) <hi>will be no leſſe ſatisfied:</hi> For that which makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge glorious, is then when a Prince hath in his power a proud and inſolent Enemy, who being the head and chief of a Faction or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, deſerves ſevereſt puniſhment, whoſe example may teach all his party to tremble, and ſtand in awe, when they behold the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and notorious Malefactor amongſt them ſo diſgracefully loſe his head: And <hi>where Clemency may be interpreted fear or cowardiſe, there in the exact preſervation of the majeſty of a Crown, it is more prudence to incline to revenge then pitty:</hi> For when one pardons, at that time, when it may be conjectured he dares not preſume to puniſh; at ſuch an inſtant Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie may be lookt on as an ambiguous Virtue: But when a Prince paſſeth an Act of Grace on ſuch conſiderate circumſtances as I have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96822:39"/>
done, upon a poore Cavalier, full of mortall wounds, at the point of death, and already ſtretcht on the Beere, who expiring the laſt minutes of his life, cloſeth them up with repentance, begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his traiterous deſigne, and then naming the Authors, and Contrivers of the black conſpiracie; it would not onely have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of cruelty, but likewiſe imprudence to have then augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his torments which cauſed his remorſe; and to have poſted him to his Grave, who had not (poſſibly) but a few moments longer to breath: But I was ſo farre from haſtening his death, that I ſhould rather have endeavoured his continuance if the cure of his wounds had been as equally in my power as my diſpoſition to pardon his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: And certainly in his great extremities the grief for his crime againſt his Prince did more ſadly affect him then the ſharpneſſe of his wounds. Theſe reaſons well weighed, no man can juſtly ſuſpect that fear or weakneſſe ſnatched this pardon from my hands, unleſſe hee will affirme, that it is a glory for a Prince to take revenge on a feeble, wounded, dying Penitentiarie, weeping, and bleeding for his crimes. <hi>Difficulty and danger equally ſet forth the glory of revenge as well as War. And if Kings were obliged in policie to puniſh all indifferently who have offended them, (They being naturally for the moſt part vindicative) they ſhould never want matter for their displeaſure to work on, nor a plenary ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their cruelty, if inclined to ſuch practiſes: For there are too many feeble Criminals in all estates, whoſe blood might he exhauſted eaſily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger (their lives or deaths being indifferently in the Princes power) as to the repoſe and quiet of their Kingdome.</hi> Now if the puniſhment I might have inflicted on this poore ſnake could not be glorious, it could not have redounded to any advantage. I have formerly told you that this Cavalier ſallied (as others) out of <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and that his evill enterpriſe was not formed in our Camp; and conſequently an example ſo ſevere and rigorous was not then neceſſary, either to keep ſecret Enemies in their Allegeance, or thereby to hinder the eruptions of their malice and rebellion: For they were publick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies who were accuſed, and who employed him. And this is (Generous Count) the difference betwixt the one and the other (if my policie faile not) that the one kind is to be terrified with feare, and the other invited by the acts and grace of love. If a King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive intelligence that ſome notable plot is deſigned againſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or his royall Throne: And that the things in agitation are not come to maturitie and ripeneſſe, but depend on ſome incertainties, ſo that his greateſt Enemies appeare loyall, as if his friends: And the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> (being of the ſame complexion) have their hearts as equally divided as their <hi>Miters</hi> (their opinions in generall being diſſentaneous) and no perſon having openly declared; In ſuch a caſe an example of puniſhment and revenge may be ſeaſonable, and neceſſary: <hi>For if a Prince be not ſometimes active in revenge, his people will conclude him too timorous, or too indulgent; and thereby be encouraged to a Revolt, which his ſeverity might have prevented.</hi> In occaſions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration ought to be had to this Maxime of Policy, <hi>That a ſeaſonable act of Juſtice (and thereby an effuſion of little blood) ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents an inundation of miſery, and takes away the cauſe of ample pardons, and unlimited Clemency.</hi> But then when ſecret devices and concealed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies break forth into publick Revolts, and open Rebellions, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96822:39"/>
ſuch deſperate reſolutions have armed the Subjects againſt their Prince: It is his buſineſſe in ſuch a caſe to know how to ſubdue In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie with true honour, and to chaſtiſe them with the Sword, as well as how to pardon them. <hi>Revenging Juſtice is not alwaies ſeaſonable, publick puniſhments are moſt fit and proper for the Battell; and when Rebels become vanquiſht priſoners, the ſureſt ſecond Conqueſt is effected on them by grace and pardon; thereby conquering as well thoſe who never came into the field, as thoſe who had the fortune to eſcape the edge of the ſword.</hi> By this meanes ſome are reclaimed, others cheerfully invited to obedience; and the Conſequence proves a double Victory. It is confeſt, this Rule is not infallible; and that <hi>ſome are ſo obſtinate and malitious, that neither pardon, nor puniſhment can regulate or ſubdue their paſſion:</hi> And as for Clemencie, they are (for the moſt part) deafe towards her mild and courteous voice (ingaged wilfully to their reſolutions with ſome wicked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) but I know well that <hi>he who is not toucht with a juſt apprehenſion of his own error or crime, will hardly be convinced by the terrors of fear;</hi> or, <hi>In the beginning of a Civill War, it is not wiſdome to make all thoſe despera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e who are guilty: For what greater miſery can happen to them, after they are once enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in miſchief, then to fall into the hands of a provoked Prince, whoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will not hearken to a ſubmiſſive Repentance? This is the way to make them reſolute even to the hazard of his own Army; ſince it often happens, that the fear of an approaching death makes men act things miraculous; and even more then can poſſibly be expected from humane power.</hi> To rebate then the truth of things; <hi>Revenge conſiſts not ſolely in the exerciſe of puniſhment; but to have power to revenge, and to be able to undertake it with facility; or (at leaſt) without danger, is undoubtedly the moſt noble and higheſt ſatisfaction in ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences: And there is often more content to ſee an enemy obliged to your ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then to ſee him expire under the torments of a rigorous ſeveritie.</hi> This example then of my moderation which I have preſented this day may be an occaſion to diſarme thoſe who ſhall be moſt violent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in the remainder of my life. It may bee in this very houre (wherein I ſpeak) ſome others may repent, and are conſulting how to caſt themſelves at my feet: And all who have revolted, hearing of this act, may be toucht with ſhame, or ſtruck with confuſion: But however if they are not yet made penitent and pliant, (I ſaid before) how rigorous ſoever it may be, ſhakes none but feeble and fearfull ſoules: But Clemency on the contrary is very affective on generous mindes, more then on others. Virtues are generally linked in ſuch a Concatenation, that what ever difference ſeemes to appear amongſt them, they are all united in building up the ſame pile, and they have (which I cannot deſcribe) a ſecret union amongſt them which cauſeth thoſe who poſſeſſe any one, to diſcerne that they have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible cohabitation with all the reſt. Thus the valiant Souldier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires Juſtice in the perſon of the Prince, the Magiſtrates honour Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Courage in the Commanders; all Noble minds, who have Heroick thoughts have a capacity and ſence of a virtuous example. But you will tell me that which aſtoniſheth us moſt in this your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not that you have pardoned a ſingle Cavalier, a Priſoner wounded, ready to dye, and begging pardon; but that you are pleaſed to conceale the names of thoſe who commended the Ponyard to his hand that was to ſtabbe you, and ſuggeſted the deſigne to attempt your life; ſince which time you have wrapped up that ſecreſie in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96822:40"/>
ſuch ſilence, that even all your faithfulleſt Subjects are intirely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe perſons who were your chiefeſt Enemies. Some of you likewiſe may object; what moves you to be of their party, and ſo to act againſt your ſelfe? Behold (noble Count) theſe are the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and thoughts which I read very legible in your countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe conjectures I daily obſerve through the impatience wherewith you have attended me hitherto. But before I ſhall give you any more reaſons which perſwaded me to an action of this kind, know this, that I ſhall be the moſt faithfull of all my Conſpirators, and that in all my life I ſhall never diſcover to any one thoſe who had deſigned my death. I know this proceeding may bee as ſingular as the example; yet I cannot be diſſwaded but that my intentions are rationall; to examine which with more ſtrictneſſe wee muſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider the intereſt of the Prince; that of his Children, that of the Families of the Conſpirators, and that of the State in general. For the firſt, it is true that it is poſſible that Poſterity may not know that there had been a conſpiracie to deſtroy their King; and perhaps it were better if it were ſo. That Hiſtory (which profeſſeth to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall, faithfull, and exact) it may thinke fit (without any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) to ſilence thoſe actions which merit eternall oblivion; and whereby the memory of the Prince could receive no advantage: And yet it is not ſo, becauſe it is not true, that wicked men conſpire as well againſt virtuous Princes as againſt Tyrants. It may be further objected, that ſuch a Record were for the ſhame of thoſe who lived in that age, and were Subjects under that Reign; and it is doubtleſſe more glorious for Kings to ſuffocate the bruit of Conſpiracies, then to perpetuate them to Poſterity. If this reaſon ſeeme not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſupport my reſolution, let us examine what utilitie may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound by the publication of that which hath been revealed. You are not ignorant (ſince wee are before <hi>Valladolid,</hi> where reſide the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> Admirall <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> Count <hi>De Medellin,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Confederates are met) That the Capitall Conſpirators are not in ſuch a place where they can eaſily be taken; That they have their Swords in their hands; That they are in a moſt ſtrong Town, and in the midſt of a conſiderable Army, and by conſequence in a condition inſolently to deny, and outface thoſe evill deſignes which I might publiſh, and to ſecure themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all attempts. If then (theſe conſideratious firſt premiſed) I ſhould condeſcend to particularize the Attempters of my life, how think you would ſuch Enemies after bee ever invited to a Treaty of Peace? Can you imagine after ſuch a declaration they will ever have a confidence in me? Again, how reſolutely, think you, they will now act? Or how doe you ſuppoſe they ought to proceed to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that which they ſhall know me to underſtand? Really, I think, they would have cauſe to make this uſe of ſuch an action in me: Nor could they provide for their own ſecurity othervviſe, then by adding one ſinne unto another. The ignominie and danger which ſuch a Publication would throw upon them, and lay them open unto, could not poſſibly be encreaſed: And being rendred thus deſperate, can you believe they would not act further to ſave thoſe lives, which for what they have already committed muſt certainly bee loſt. No, no (Noble Count) theſe muſt neceſſarily be the events, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96822:40"/>
I ſhall not repent my having been ſecret and faithfull to my Enemies. <hi>Crimes voluntarily repented of, merit leſſe of accuſation, ſo ſometimes ſhame directeth the offenders to the way to vertue, whoſe perſons would never return if their faults were publiſhed.</hi> Therefore <hi>we are never to divulge a crime but what we are able (if God pleaſe) to puniſh.</hi> If Kings were to act as their Subjects, then undoubtedly a truth of this importance were not to be concealed or diſguiſed, becauſe <hi>the hatred of one particular perſon doth uſually laſt with his life, and it may be that which he doth not effect at one time, he may execute at another.</hi> But it is not ſo with <hi>Princes. Malice ordinari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y is not directed towards their perſons, but their power.</hi> And conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies deſigned againſt them, are for the moſt part upon cauſes which continue not long upon equall foundations: For we ſee that Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators themſelves (according to events) alter their intentions. <hi>Such politick Artiſts there are, who may attempt the life of the Prince; And yet a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of affairs may command them to hazard their own for his ſafety.</hi> As for obtaining their deſires, they are ſometime wearied with them, and they may chance to looſe their evill intentions, becauſe never pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht to the World; and <hi>an evill conſtellation being paſt, it may ſo prove the Prince to be no leſſe in ſafety with criminall penitentiaries, then he hath been amongſt his ſubjects who have been alwaies faithfull.</hi> Secrecy and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in ſuch points and caſes, is moſt conſiderable. For if I had accuſed the Conſpirators by a Manifeſto (whether they had the Grandees, Nobles, and Commons on their party, or not,) It is certain they might have anſwered (as tis naturall) that they loved not to own and avow a wicked action; they might publiſh that this accuſation (though never ſo true) was a Calumny to decry their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thereby render my integrity ſuſpected to the greateſt part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Beſides, after publication they might frame better diſguiſes then before, and ſo with new intentions more ably delude, and gaine their ends. But as things now are, I have underſtood their deſign by the ſingle report of one who hath deciphered their intimate actions; and I am adviſed which way the wheel of their thoughts turned: which inſpection they not diſcerning, I ſhall read within their hearts, and ſee the moſt concealed of their intentions, and deſtroy them (if I pleaſe) with great facility. I may then with prudence, ſilence their names, and attend, without danger, their repentance, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perill declare the Criminalls. Yet may ſome one ſay, do you not believe by their ſpies that the Conſpirators know that one of their party hath conferred with you in ſecret, and then they cannot but imagine that it was to betray their deſignes, and conſequently they conclude with themſelves as much as if you had accuſed them openly? To that I anſwer, there is ever a notable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ambiguity and certainty. Thoſe who act not but with ſome doubt, do little more with precaution then if they had meerly known nothing: And thoſe who doubt not at all, may perhaps become faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to my ſervice by the ſole conſideration of an action ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. I know well that ſome men may cenſure that a piece of Artifice which in me is an effect of Prudence and Bounty: Policy in this caſe may be able to ſerve to two intentions intirely different (when I pleaſe) to one end, and to explicate the moſt clear &amp; apparent actions as I ſhall judge fit. But as Kings ought not to attribute ſo much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humane prudence, as to ſecret aſſiſtances inſpired to them from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96822:41"/>
Heaven in the moſt emergent difficulties; I believe in the election of pardon, or puniſhment, ſecrecy, or diſcoveries, it is permitted indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to follow that way which my reaſon tells me is moſt noble, and generous, as neither thwarting with the rules of wiſdom, nor oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the meanes of ſafety. Now, if after the conſideration of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces intereſt it may prove neceſſary to adviſe of the good of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; It is moſt important to an eſtate, that he who is to aſcend the Royall Throne ought to be free from all Malice, Paſſion, and Intereſt: And how can that be if the ſucceſſor underſtand, that the Inheritors of the moſt illuſtrious houſes of his Kingdome joyned in Conſpiracy to take away his Fathers life? If he be a dutifull Son, and one who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally honoured his Father, he cannot (but with difficulty) forbear to extinguiſh their memory; and if he be jealous and ſuſpitious, he will more hardly confide in their perſons. Therefore Kings never ought to eſpouſe particular intereſts, and when they receive the Crown by their Fathers death, it is beſt to bury in their Fathers Tombes all their quarrells, their diſpleaſure and revenge; and the Succeſſor is to guard nothing more choicely in his heart, then a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal love to his Subjects. It is then moſt neceſſary (when it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to conceal conſpiracies from thoſe who are to ſucceed, leaſt a preoccupant fear poſſeſſe their ſpirits, and make them commit great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er overſights in rendring thoſe uncapable as to any office or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who though they have committed great Crimes, yet having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, are more fit and able to exerciſe them then any others, and by this means perpetuating an Enmity between the Prince and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Now as the relation is neceſſary between the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is important as towards the Conſpirators Families, that their Crimes be rather concealed then publick, chiefly when they are ſo notorious, that they not onely merit revenge, but ſpread an Infamy which deriveth a bitter taſte to future poſterity. Wherefore ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious blemiſhes are not to be unadviſedly branded or fixed on il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious houſes, becauſe their race and linage are the force and ſtrength which ſupporteth Crownes. The Princes in this caſe ought to be tender of their Glory, as a beam of his own Majeſty, and as to this purpoſe a prudent concealment of their crimes may render more advantage then a raſh diſcovery; for why, their faults were perſonall, and it may not prove ſound Policy to make their crimes ſo immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, as not to be forgotten in any Succeſſion of ages. This were to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them odious to the people, and to remove them from that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſpect, which being united to them, may be ſerviceable to the Prince.</p>
               <p>Again, as it may prove no good policy, ſo it may be queſtioned whether it be an act of juſtice to make the Conſpirators iſſue beare a part of their Aunceſtors puniſhment for their delinquency; which proceedings (unleſſe Affaires of ſtate judge them neceſſary) may prove very dangerous; For <hi>a King alone formes not a Kingdome, he is but the head of that great body; the Grandees (next under him) make up the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts:</hi> There muſt then be great Caution of diſhonouring and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing too much, and too long thoſe members, which, as the Armes and Shoulders immediately bear up the head. By all this it appears that whether we look on the ſafety of my perſon, the ſplendor of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, the good of my Succeſſor, or that of my Enemies, whether the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96822:41"/>
advancement of Peace or of the State: We may eaſily judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be more Prudence to conceale what hath (in this caſe) been concealed, then to publiſh it to the World, in which reſpect I ſhall not eaſily change my reſolution. If mine Enemies ſhall continue obſtinate in their Crime, I ſhall not fail of other pretexts, whereby to puniſh them, if it ſo happen that they fall under my power. Their being in Rebellion is a Crime ſufficient to take away their lives, with Juſtice, without a farther accuſation of their being <hi>Paricides</hi> or <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides:</hi> And if they be capable to correct themſelves, I ſhall exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoyce to have extracted ſo fair an advantage out of their offence and my own ſilence. Moreover if they prove perſons of ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and more noble quality, who have attempted my life, without doubt I have proceeded judiciouſly, as not having diſcovered my intentions to either pardon or puniſh: Seeing that as yet they are not in my power; if the Conſpirators were men of the middle rank, it were then ſuperfluous to divulge their names, whoſe perſons are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as ſcarce known, and if they were men of the loweſt qualitie, it would reflect with too much diſhonor on Royall Majeſtie, to deſcend to an exact diſcovery of ſuch low ſhrubbs, who like Bryers and Thornes have been bound up together in ſuch a black Conſpiracy. <hi>He who keepeth the hearts of Kings in his own hands, reſerveth Lightning and Thunder in his own power, which he can let fall (when he pleaſeth) to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction who ſhall oppreſſe their Prince. It is meet to referre ſome parts of Juſtice, to the God of Vengeance, and not to preſume on the exerciſe of all power he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on us.</hi> I ſay not this but with reſolution, that if the authors of the Conſpiracy were in my hands; I ſhould ſeverely chaſtiſe them, yet not for their particular injury to my perſon, but for their impardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crime againſt the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which puniſhment were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite for the ſafety of my ſelfe, but likewiſe of my ſucceſſors. So then, if they were in my preſent power, their puniſhments ſhould be as notorious and remarkable as their Crime; But ſeeing I am the onely perſon alive, who can accuſe them, I ſhall forbear, and rather prevent (if I can) their evill deſignes: As for thoſe who ſhall continue obdurate and obſtinate, I ſhall be revenged on them otherwiſe, Taking pleaſure to pardon thoſe who do repent; And I value it not a little ſatisfaction to ſave and preſerve the honor of ſo many great Families, and the lives of ſo many perſons, rejoycing at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of my own affections in this Provocation which renders to me no ſmall Victory.</p>
               <p>In all other occaſions it is dangerous to have the Witneſſe to be the Judge, but in this caſe it is moſt advantageous to my Enemies, that I alone can accuſe them of their Crimes, which if known, my ſecret could neither preſerve them nor me: I could not longer be Maſter of that particular, becauſe the Laws would importune my Juſtice. But ſeeing heaven is pleaſed, that he who revealed their crime is already dead, I ſhall onely be the Arbitrator of their Deſtiny, and convert my power to no other ſervice then to afford means to amend, and reclaim them from their wicked courſe. It is true in this Conjuncture, that the Royall authority which I have in my hands leads me nearer to the <hi>Throne of God, who knows the most ſecret crimes of all hearts, but forbears publiſh them. He brands not the wicked with particular Marks, but leaves to their Malice lockt up within the circle of their own hearts.</hi> And it often
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96822:42"/>
falls out, that <hi>his terrible Judgements which cauſe us to tremble here, foretell thoſe great puniſhments which the wicked may for their reward expect hereafter.</hi> Some ſay, <hi>that ſecreſie is one of the moſt eſſentiall Attributes of the Divinity, and it is by it alone whereby it is preſented more adorable, and more venerable with men.</hi> Doe not admire then if I onely be content to know my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies without their diſcovery; ſeeing I have learnt this practice from God himſelf, who courteth us to his curteſies, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives addreſſes from thoſe who he draws unto him; and whom he is ſo far from puniſhing, that he promotes not ſo much as a particular accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt them. Permit me then (moſt generous Count) permit me (I ſay) to leave the care of my revenge to him who beſt knowes how to uſe it. If he pleaſe that my Enemies ſhall be converted out of ſhame, and ſelf confuſion, he can do it by wayes unknown to us. And as he hath given me power to be ſilent, he can force them to ſpeake, and accuſe each other then when they leaſt dreame of it. Come on then, let us march and fight without accuſing them. Let us not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede, nor diſhonour the Victory at which we ayme in diſcovering them to be Paricides: Let us act with Princely reſolution, and not longer deferre our power: Let us exerciſe our ſtrength that we may have occaſion to uſe our Clemencie: And let us make the World ſee that it is far more glorious to conceal and conquer our ſecret adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then barely to pardon our declared enemies.</p>

                  <p>IN the diverſity of opinions of ſeverall judgments, when I conſider this action of the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> I confeſſe I agree with him, and I acknowledge his Choice the better. There are ſome diſeaſes which are not curable but by gentle remedies, which (as the Phyſitians ſay) will prove more dangerous with appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Corroſives. When the body hath an arm or legg putrified, the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may imploy his knife, or ſeare with fire, or cut off the rotten member to preſerve the reſt; but when the whole falls into an indiſpoſition, and that the more noble parts are infected, the Phyſitian and Chirurgion would not onely be cenſured raſh, but mad, if they ſhould undertake to cure an infirmity or diſtemper above the force of Art and Nature, and which did almoſt require a Miracle to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. <hi>It is not good to force an Enemy into deſpair, if a man have not abſolute power to deſtroy him. The extremity of perill (as this Prince ſaid) cauſeth often the greateſt Cowards to become deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately valiant. And many, who would willingly make a fair retreat from miſchief, if they could aſſure themſelves of ſecurity by being unknown, reſolve to venture the worſt of hazards if diſcovered.</hi> The Scripture counſelleth, <hi>be ye wiſe as Serpents:</hi> and if this Counſell be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to any, it is principally to Kings; The <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks</hi> placed an eye on the top of their Scepter, to repreſent Providence, and to adviſe Kings in that Royall Embleme: This eye alwaies open, taught them that they could not too carefully regard what they intended to Act; <hi>The King of the Bees hath no ſting</hi> (as the naturaliſts obſerve) which teacheth <hi>Princes not to be tranſported with the violence of their paſſions, and to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate rather on Clemency, as more naturall, then on rigour which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declines.</hi> I know not whether thoſe who preſented Iuſtice with a Ribband

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Acknowledge as well as you (moſt Generous Count) that this wanton Fortune, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved mee from a Kingdome, and reſtored my health (which I never enjoyed whilſt I poſſeſſed the Crown) muſt as neceſſarily work extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary alterations in my ſoul, (Contraries never meeting but they effect ſomething) And with as much reaſon as ſhe hath raiſed wonder in yours: &amp; a curioſity which (as I have obſerved) I ſhall rather ſatisfie then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. Will you then that I diſcover in what condition I finde my ſoule after ſo ſtrange an event? And whether the griefe for what I have loſt, ſinkes not deeper into my heart then the joy for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that I have received by the exchange? It is certaine (to ſpeake the truth) that the Philoſophy of the Stoicks (which teacheth men to be without all Paſſion) is not ſufficient to reſtrain all grief in ſuch a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious alteration, as falling from a royall Throne to the low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a private perſon: Yet it is true that a deſcent from the higheſt degree of honour, and power is leſſe ingrate, and unpleaſant, and more tolerable to a rationall mind, where the condition chiefly ſerveth for the recovery of health, which is a treaſure ſo pretious to bee enjoyed with the leaſt diſguſt or regret, as being the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of mans life, and therefore moſt univerſally ſought after. All the advantages of Fortune and Nature have not ſo generall an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. We find <hi>ſome ambitious ſoules have aspired to, and uſurped Crowns and Scepters; others have refuſed theſe royall dignities, as places too preciviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and too full of cares and troubles. Some torment themſelves with the gain of riches, hazarding their lives to fill their baggs, which others</hi> (as more wiſe) <hi>doe leſſe regard and value. Glory with all its ſplendor is leſſe regarded by perſons devoted to piety;</hi> And <hi>ſome as ſeriously ſhunne thoſe gliſtering beams as others follow and adore them. In fine, Some look on a Throne as a high and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rock; on Riches as a bait to Vice; on Glory as a dispoſition to pride, and vanity: Nay even Beauty (which ſeemes to be a beam of Divinity it ſelf) is looked on but as a great evill, when it is not accompanied with modeſty and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But for health, it is a Jewell which is of the higheſt price with Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with Philoſophers and Fooles; never was there yet any perſon found which did not put an infinite valuation on her above all concomitants of this life.</hi> We meet with one ſort of Philoſophers who had the impudency to affirme, <hi>that there was effectively no ſuch thing as grief.</hi> But without doubt the ſame Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher

when he loſt his health, had his Principles ſhaken, and his content and joy were changed into griefe and ſadneſſe In the mean time (to ſatisfie you more amply) you are not to conſider me meerly as a King, but as a private perſon to whom a birth and death is equally common with the meaneſt of my ſubjects; in which capacitie our reſentments are the ſame. It is true, in relation to our divine Character (which is inſeparable from Royalty) wee are farre above them. But in reſpect of God, and our ſelves, we are ſometimes their equals, and may bee their inferiors. Wee participate with them of all the infirmities of life, and as we enjoy the ſame Sunne and Elements in common, ſo we have not other Armes then they to guarde us from humane paſſions, and the debilities of Nature. Guards of faithfull Subjects may defend their Prince from the Treaſon of a Paricide, but an Army of thirtie thouſand men cannot hinder the ſtroak of death, nor one fit of a Feaver: Death will enter the ſtatelieſt and ſtrongeſt Palace (without reſiſtance) when ſhe pleaſeth; and the moſt beautifull, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent glory cannot aſſwage the leaſt pain or anguiſh: Diadems, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Crowns are unſerviceable ornaments to cure the diſeaſes of the body: And I have found my ſelf often in a Princely Palace, in a magnifick Chamber, lying in a bed glittering all with gold, environ'd with the Grandees of my Kingdome, where all my attendance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned nothing elſe but my diverſions and eaſe: When in the midſt of all theſe ſeeming contents, I judged my ſelf the moſt miſerable of all men, envying the health of the meaneſt of my ſubjects: Death which I have often contemned in the midſt of battailes, in this condition looked grim and formidable: And when I could neither fight nor retreat, give battail, or reſiſt the Enemy; I found that I was as well a man as a King; and (upon juſt conſultation with my ſelf) that <hi>it was very difficult to be a ſick Patient, and a ſound Polititian, to govern the people, being perſonally weak, and in a great diſorder; and not to be exceeding miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable when all pleaſures had a bitter relliſh. Death (as terrible as ſhe is) will command and make Kings and Subjects equall, her buſineſſe being to levell all alike.</hi> But in this caſe Kings are not onely afflicted as other men being ſick, but more unfortunate. The chiefeſt point then (in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is to ſeek after health, which is interrupted by Secretaries, who interrupt every minute of repoſe, and perſecute with multitude of affairs, as well as Phyſicians with preſcriptions of various remedies. The deprivation of pleaſure and augmentation of pain are equally tormenting. A ſick Prince judgeth by the contenance of his Viſitors the variety of all their humours, which rather encreaſeth then allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his paſſion; he readeth their deſires in their faces. Some for their own ends fear his death, and others wiſh it: In this ſad condition he is more unfortunate then any of his Subjects, as not enjoying any pleaſure of a King. The higher he is advanced and elevated on the Throne, the greater muſt his deſires be: The Crown ſeemes too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, yet he cannot when he pleaſeth quit that burthen; the Scepter too ponderous for his feeble hand, and his affairs permit him not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably to part with what he cannot hold but painfully. In this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he is willing to act, but cannot; to reign, but is made incapable. In theſe impoſſible contrarieties he can eaſily judge what is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affliction can arrive to a King, and that is to be deprived of health. For imagine with your ſelves to what a deplorable extremity is a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96822:44"/>
Prince reduced, when a Counſellor ſhall tell him (being ſick and ſad with pain) that his Subjects have revolted, that his Neighbour Princes have in vaded his Territories, that his Generall hath loſt the Battell, that many of his Townes have ſurrendred themſelves to the Enemy, that a pannick terror hath ſeized upon his people, that his Troopes have disbanded for want of a chiefe Commander, that a puiſſant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is on their march to beſiedge him, that his Allies keep not their faith, and that within a few daies (before he could remove) he ſhould hear the noiſe of the Canons playing before his Gates, that his Palace ſhall become his priſon, and that notwithſtanding his ſickneſſe gives him neither free choice of life or death, he ſhall yet fall into a lower extremity of miſery, and be reduced to the power and pleaſure of his enemy: Tell me (noble <hi>Garcia)</hi> if a Crown in ſuch a condition be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable; and Royalty (though never ſo magnificent) to bee valued at ſuch a rate and degree worthy of envy? <hi>All thoſe who are ambitious to bee Kings are not</hi> (doubtleſſe) <hi>without the paſſion of deſiring glory mixt with pleaſure,</hi> but of what glory or pleaſure is that Prince capable whoſe conſtant buſineſſe is to ſupport his infirmities? And who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the delights of a Crown cannot enjoy a moment of repoſe? If the Prince be evill, it is not poſſible but a remorſe for his crimes muſt intermixe with his Maladies to increaſe his torments: If he be good and virtuous, it is impoſſible but that he ſhall be afflicted, being incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to act in his Kingly office for the repoſe and conſervation of his people: At leaſt I know well, during this languiſhing condition, being on the Throne, nothing can be more inſupportable then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſickneſs is the infirmity of the State; and that I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not a ſingle paine, but that the diſeaſe becomes contageous to all the ſubjects. It is true theſe griefes of body which daily obſcure the light of my underſtanding, (if I may reaſon without prejudice to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paſſages) I confeſs freely are not onely inſupportable to my ſelf, but to all my affairs, and it may be cenſured a fault, that finding my ſelf unfit to Reign, I did not chooſe to govern by the aſſiſtance and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of my Succeſſor: but the jealouſie which ordinarily attendeth Soveraign authority, prevailed with me in my reſolutions, not to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate that to him, whom I feared as more worthy: I rather choſe to ſupport a Scepter with a feeble and trembling hand, then admit of a Coadjutor, and to ſuffer that to bee taken from mee rather by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then to be ecclipſed by a ſuper officious-aſſiſtant, who would convert my Soveraignty intirely to his own ſervice and ſplendor. Lo (moſt noble Count) the crime for which I am culpable, and ſuch a one as all Kings ought to avoyd who are rendered uncapable to reign by their diſeaſes, or who ſhall find themſelves imperfect through their owe infirmities: For a Prince (whom ſuch evils do obſtruct; or who through that leſſer Talent which God hath given him for the conduct of the people, is not able to diſcharge that high office with honour) is reſponſible before God for all the evils which may happen through his defective Government, or at leaſt if he chooſe not an able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State who may ſupply a remedy in theſe great failings: And it is for that reaſon (without doubt) that Princes are obliged, whether they be ſick or well, of ſtronger or weaker judgements, to have ever near them faithfull and wiſe Counſellors, to whom they may communicate a beam of their power, to that end that it may not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96822:44"/>
fail. That if the Princes be weak, their judgement may ſupport them, and if not, that they may refreſh them, and ſo contribute ſome leaſure for their repoſe, after their grand agitations, in ſuch great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>God (whoſe Image are Kings) acts not alwaies by his judgements, or thoſe terrible means, which ſeem more directly and ſuddainly to fall from his hand:</hi> Thoſe violent plagues which deſolate whole Countries, come not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year; God imployes not alwaies his Thunderclaps, nor Famine, nor dreadfull Earthquakes, which ſhake the foundation of the World: Such puniſhments (being very heavy) arrive but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He ſerves himſelf ſometimes with Princes, whom he commands to wage a Warre, againſt thoſe whom he pleaſeth to prove or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; And then (when hee pleaſeth alſo) to be propitious to a people or Country, he doth not alwaies ſhew his mercy in cauſing <hi>Manna</hi> to raine on them, or manifeſt himſelf by miracles. He pleaſeth himſelf ſomtimes to ſend vertuous Princes, appointing them to be the diſtributors of his Bleſſings, as (on other occaſions) he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to be the Executioners of his Juſtice. Let Princes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ceaſe to be jealous of their Authority; And ſince God (without any obligation) is pleaſed to uſe them as his inſtruments, let them not ſcorne (eſpecially ſince their own neceſſities and concernments ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to it) to make uſe of Faithfull Miniſters, who are the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute foundation of Thrones and Kingdome. For thoſe Princes who are ſo fortunate as to meet with them, (of this glorious quality) may defie Fortune and diſeaſes, and not fear the confuſion of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when they languiſh on their Couches. It is good for a King to reſemble the Sun whoſe office is to inlighten all the univerſe; Yet this Noble imployment (which the Creator hath given him) doth not make the illuſtrious Creature jealous of the beames and beauty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtars, which in their ſeverall Spheares of their Activity diſtribute their light which they have received, as well, though not as bright as that great eye of the World. Yet is there a diſtinction to be allowed betwixt the chief Miniſter which the Prince chooſeth, and another which aſpireth to that truſt (moved by his own ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires) the firſt is like a fixed Star, the other as a blazing Comet, which at preſent, caſteth a ſtupendious and mervailous light, but the flame borrowed from a wrong Source, is exſtinguiſht in a moment; On the contrary the fixed Star which is luminous, retaines its ſplendor and brightneſſe as long as the Originall light ſhall impart his beams unto it. Things thus ſtated, one may ſay, that the Pompe and glory, which the Sun receives, when he is ſet, (when in the night we ſee the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens adorned with radiant Starts) the Prince, when the beames of his active power are obſcured with ſickneſſe, enjoyeth; though he do not act in his own perſon, but by thoſe to whom he hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Rayes of his power; And in them he ſtill retaineth his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and Honour: But alas, I conſidered not the depth of this Policy, untill I had loſt my Kingdom; And after I was rendred into a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be able to do nothing elſe, but examine my ſelf whether I ſhould be more happy in my health without a Crown, or elſe ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a ſick and languiſhing Prince. I am aſſured (Generous Count) by this diſcourſe that you can eaſily judge, that the Crown which I wore was platted with Thornes; And if I ſhould grudge at my loſſe, it is not for the deprivation of thoſe pleaſures I have received. Yet if I had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96822:45"/>
loſt it after the defeat of a battail, if I had then met with this ſad ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, to make mine Enemies ſee (in my couragious defence) that I had deſerved to wear it; And that though they gained the Victory, it was becauſe they were more fortunate, and not more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant then I; ſome matter might have been found for my Conſolation. But to have languiſhed ſo long a time as you have known me, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the pleaſure of peace, and conſtrained to quit the Warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not able to be in the head of my Armies, and to ſee my ſelf ſtript of the Crown and Scepter without a defenſive power, to guard thoſe Emblems of Royallty; This conſideration affecteth me with griefe and pain unſupportable. If I were in an active condition, it may be ſome ſignall occaſion might make me fortunate ſo far, as to provoke mine Enemies valour by mine own, and to oblige them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orce me to hazard and looſe my life gloriouſly. But the infirmities of my body have made me unfit to Reign, and almoſt to live: and nothing but a prodigious accident can recover my health after that I have loſt all things that are dear to me. I ſhall now relate to you with what joy I have ſeen this civill Warre of my body to ceaſe, which continued my griefe for ſo long a time. It will not prove ſo eaſie for me to deſcribe to you the regrett I had in the loſſe of mine eſtate, if you had not been an eye witneſſe of what I ſuffered. Imagine then your ſelf, by thoſe troubles I endured, what repoſe and tranquillity I now poſſeſſe. Not but that I eaſily believe that the continuation of health may abate much of this high content and joy which I now feel; Nor that an accuſtomed ſubjection will not in time make me forget my being King. But really if I ſhould be reſtored to the Crown with the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of my infirmitie, I ſhould not accept it; more valuing health without a Crown, then to be an infirm King unable to Reign. Tis true, ambition is ſweet, and that nothing is more difficult, then for a King to make his Subjects his Peers. But when I ſhall be as inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a Statue through the violence of my diſeaſes; the intereſt of the people and Chriſtian Policy would teach me to refuſe that Crown which would as much prejudice them, as it would diſhonor my ſelf. The Ambitious may object, that it is a great loſſe, to be deprived of a Crown; But to that I anſwer, it is no great advantage to bear it without honor, and to have no Fruits, but diſtemper in ſuch eminent dignity. They will ſay, that the torture of the body may be born up, by the ſatisfaction of the mind; But I anſwer to the contrary, that the pureſt contemplations of the Soul are troubled by the indiſpoſition of the Body. There is a bond of nature which ſo ſtrictly unites both parties, that nothing can divide their intereſt, and, if at any time there be any difference, there is much more from the indiſpoſition of the body, then from the diſſatisfaction of the mind. How many great and noble Soules have we ſeen ſo reſolved, that the moſt violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions could not ſhake into diſorder, and their vexations ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as not to diſtemper their health to an alteration? Many have loſt their Children who have never chang'd their countenance, and good or bad Fortune hath not prevailed againſt their compoſure, becauſe their reaſon was not diſturbed. But as for Corporall paine, when it is ſuch, as the Phyſition cannot eaſe nor cure with all his art; It muſt needs operate and have ſuch an influence upon the ſoul, as fift give her not an abſolute diſtemper, it will (at leaſt) ſhrewdly ſhake
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96822:45"/>
the Patient. Servitude, Poverty, and Infamy, are more tollerable; but for extremities of pain, they infallibly baniſh all pleaſure and joy. Love, Ambition, Glory, can yeild no peaceable ſatisfaction to a ſick perſon; and though the Soul be the more noble part, yet in ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>olent fits, no other vertue hath its operation, but Patience. And how imperially ſoever the Soul may brag of her Superiour excellency; There reſts nothing to be acted (on ſuch occaſions) but what are the effects of that vertue. Corporall pain ariſeth from a naturall or accidentall infirmity in man, but the vexations and anxieries of the mind, are voluntary, and meerly depend on the will. Soveraignty not Royally managed, is a ſupreme diſgrace, and to have a Scepter which he cannot ſway, is as if a Souldier wear a ſword and cannot draw it. Policie which ſupporteth Kingdomes is but a bad Phyſitian, and cates which attend them are not Remedies and applications for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of health. Mortality is but a weak Comforter; And as for the Jewell of health, it is not ſo much priſed as it ought; all other things are attended with ſome inquietude, as Riches, Honour, power. Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is inflamed with new deſires, love is attended with jealouſie, care watcheth the Rich mens Gates, who have more vexation in their Poſſeſſion then content and ſatisfaction; health alone is obſerved or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily with leaſt ſolicitude and obſervation. Yet to conclude (as one able to judge, out of a long languiſhing experience) I cannot but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre health above a Scepter, the one cauſing me ever to ſweat or ſigh, the other rendring me cheerfull and pleaſant, though never ſo low. Ask me not then (Noble Count) whether choice I better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, ſeeing the Memory of thoſe outcryes paſſed, force me to praiſe God for a more comfortable alteration.</p>

The Diademe, the Scepter, the Crown, the Throne, are glorious objects which tickle, and ſweetly pleaſe the imagination: <hi>But when the torments of the Gout, the Colick, and the extreamities of other diſeaſes, wholly poſſeſſe the Patient, and are placed in oppoſition to thoſe glorious and lighter Fancies, a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Slave is far more happy then a royall King.</hi> In the midſt of ſuch Grandeur, Princes ſeated in ſuch a condition (though never ſo illuſtrious) are like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who in their abundance are not admitted to taste of any thing that may yeeld them eaſe, or content: So that what ſhould raiſe their felicity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth their puniſhment, being yet more miſerable that they can command all things, but nothing to their proper uſe; when the paine they ſuffer mixeth gall and bitterneſſe with all ſweet appearances of their Scepters. The Gout and Stone confute the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who deny all paine and paſſion: And I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a King (though never ſo magnificent,) is deprived of all earthly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96822:46"/>
comforts or enjoyments, ſuffering under the extremities of a diſeaſe. I cannot but compare the condition of ſick Princes to thoſe direfull Scaffolds which are richly cover'd with black Velvet, and (for greater state) have the splendor of Torches to conduct a Prince to his execution: This funeral pomp imprints ſome reſpect of his misfortune to all spectators, but they do not attenuate his miſeries. It is thus with the magnificence of Princes, it ſeemes to flouriſh, and cauſeth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, it attracteth reverence, but all this glory is not ſufficient to render him a happy man who is a ſick King, though he were the Emperour of all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Grandure can have no more then the effects of Dormant and <hi>Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> remedies: ſome intermiſſive moments of ſleep may ſuſpend, but cannot heal the violence of the diſeaſe, which will return, in its Courſe. How unfortunate then is a Prince who in great conjunctures of Affaires, hath ſcarce leaſure to be ſick, though he cannot meet with one minute wherein he is ſenſible of health; He bears a burthen ſo great, that it would cauſe <hi>Atlas</hi> to yeild, whilſt he finds himſelf daily growing weak, and his ſpirits every minute decaying; His occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons call him to every part, but his diſeaſes oblige him conſtantly to his bed, and whereas he ought to ſee and ſeek about to order and Command, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of theſe royall imployments, he is able to doe nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. He is (in fine) in this condition, a meere object of pitty or ſcorne; where he ought to appear awfull and formidable; and therefore I conclude that <hi>Don Sanche</hi> had reaſon to preferre his health above his Crown, and to conſolate himſelf in the loſſe of the one, by the conſideration of the Importance of the other. <hi>A King ought to die ſtanding on his feet,</hi> was the ſpeech of a Royall Prince, and certainly if he ought to be found dying in this poſture, much more ought he to appear ſo living; ſince that <hi>without health Kings are not eaſily obeyed, nor can their Reign be happy.</hi> We find ſome generalls who have gained battailes in their Litters: but I think we have not read of any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs who have raigned gloriouſly on their bedds, unleſſe it be thoſe Bedds of Juſtice, where Majesty, not Maladies appear. Kings in their Thrones are as that univerſall ſpirit which the Greeks called <hi>Endelechia.</hi> If their influence be not over all their Dominions, all goes ill, and if they be ſick, all parts preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow diſtempered. But let us leave now the Kings of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and direct our diſcourſe to a King of <hi>Portugall.</hi> It may be the ambitious will judge it no leſſe a Paradox then that of <hi>DON SANCHE,</hi> and that they will believe him as ſick in mind as the other was in body. But I conceive judicious perſons wil not be of their opinion; and that true policy will condemn their errors. <hi>Emanuell the firſt</hi> leavied a moſt puiſſant Army, with a deſign to paſſe into <hi>Affrica,</hi> where Victory ſeemed to attend him: When as being upon his march, and juſt ready to tranſport his Army over thoſe ſtreights which divide <hi>Spain</hi> &amp; <hi>Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> diſpatcht <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> to intreat ſuccors from him as their Ally, against the <hi>Turk,</hi> who had now declared War againſt them. This generous <hi>Prince</hi> reſolutely ſuſpended his hopes of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> to aſſiſt his antient Friends, ſuddainly altered his deſign, and ſent his Army intirely to them, deferring his enterpriſe to <hi>Algiers</hi> to another ſeaſon. See here the reaſons which obliged this illuſtrious <hi>Prince</hi> to his reſolution, and the true Motives of ſo glorious an action.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Am not ignorant <hi>(Meneſais)</hi> that the deſign of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts is as naturall in Kings, as life it ſelf in other men: Yet I likewiſe know that <hi>Glory</hi> ought not to be the only object of their ſublime paſſion: And if they judge it as proper to ſuccour and aſſiſt their Allyes, as to create new ſubjects; Then the quality of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors is as honorable as the Titles of <hi>Conquerors.</hi> It is in this noble reſentment that I have changed my reſolution: And though I have ingaged the greateſt part of my Grandees into Armes, and covered the Sea with Ships, with a deſign to extend my Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons over all <hi>Barbarie:</hi> I am (this day) otherwiſe reſolved to ſuccour the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and not farther to intend my deſigned Conqueſts. But have you well examined the matter? (you may tell me in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) It may be, the ſad Complaints of your <hi>Allyes</hi> have ſurpriſed your thoughts; whereas had you purſued your own inclinations, or followed the heat of your own ambitions; You had not then quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your former deſign to take up another, which (probably) will not increaſe but diminiſh your ſubjects with a diſadvantage as unprofitable as dangerous. No <hi>(Meneſais)</hi> I took not up this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a tumult of paſſions, but have moſt ſeriouſly examined the reaſons and inforcements to this alteration. And after a more ſolemn debate, I find that <hi>Juſtice, Generoſity, Wiſdome,</hi> and true <hi>Renown,</hi> have poſſeſſd my heart, and prevailed with me, in this perſwaſion, to invite me to act as I have undertaken. I do avow withall, that theſe mighty Forces, which I have raiſed (though very formidable) have not ſo elevated my hopes to new <hi>Conquests,</hi> as my deſires inflame me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my <hi>Allies,</hi> though I might with greater eaſe have ſubdued the <hi>Barbars,</hi> then have protected the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> It is moſt true, the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Conqueſts is an honorable ambition, very active in the hearts of all high born and generous <hi>Princes.</hi> And as the firſt Kings began their <hi>Raignes,</hi> and <hi>inlarged</hi> their <hi>Domination</hi> by their <hi>Conqueſts,</hi> and have derived them on the People and Subjects There ſeemes a kind of <hi>Noble Princelike</hi> neceſſity to oblige them to a Correſpondency of their firſt honorable Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mencements. So that (in ſome degrees both of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Policy) <hi>Princes</hi> are bound to expatiate the Grandure of their <hi>Territories</hi> and <hi>Dominions;</hi> And it could not but reflect as an indignity, and ſome diſhonor to <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> to confine themſelves within the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96822:47"/>
limits of their <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> The alterations, and ſignall changes (diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable in all Hiſtories) ſeeme to authorize what is here affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the ſucceſſes of Ages (which have ſeen the ruines of ſo many <hi>Monarchies,</hi> and <hi>Empires)</hi> witneſſe to theſe times, the great numbers of <hi>Conquerors</hi> which have appeared in all Ages; ſo that the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Parthians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> advanced not their names, nor inlarged their Dominations but by <hi>Conqueſts;</hi> and (at laſt) were not deſtroyed but by the ſame meanes that they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed: The fall of one <hi>Empire</hi> ever giving occaſion to the riſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; whilſt in the great conjuncture of all diſorders, it may be ſaid, that either <hi>Princes</hi> became <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and were oppreſſors, or <hi>Subjects</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Rebels</hi> and traiterouſly oppreſſed their Soveraignes: And in all Ages paſt, the ambition of <hi>Conqueſts</hi> hath been the moſt violent paſſion in all minds which have aimed at <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> Subjects are of more confined qualities, limited with proportions amongſt their neighbors, inſlaved to Laws, and limited to ſome certain parcels, deſcending to them as their Fathers heirs, to exceed which, were as much danger as Injuſtice. But <hi>Soveraigns</hi> are confined, and their uſurpations more tolerable and innocent, becauſe of their eminent and high degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other men, and their proximity to <hi>ſupernal</hi> and coeleſtiall power. We declare then (noble <hi>Meneſais)</hi> that it is not for petty conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that we prefer the title of <hi>Protector</hi> above that of <hi>Conqueror.</hi> And though Princes are ranked as higheſt in quality, and ſo above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet they are not (being Chriſtians) ſo much to regard their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition as Juſtice. As for titles, and even thoſe which ſeem derived from the Princes greateſt virtues, the ſubjects challenge a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; and they will diſpute, that <hi>JUST</hi> is an Epethite as wel belonging to a Magiſtrate as a royal Prince; that <hi>VALIANT</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs as well to a private Souldier as to the <hi>Emperour:</hi> All the virtues are as habitable, and as content to dwell with the meaneſt Subject as the mightieſt <hi>Monarch;</hi> and 'tis true, that all United cannot ſet forth the Majeſty and ſplendor of a <hi>Soveraign;</hi> he who ſaies one is <hi>Juſt,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not neceſſarily that he is a <hi>King,</hi> or that one who is <hi>Valiant</hi> muſt needs be a <hi>Monarch;</hi> but he who ſaith he is a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> concludes that title which can onely belong to an illuſtrious Prince. The power of the Sword which protecteth or puniſheth, is onely reſerved in their hands who are inveſted with ſupreame Authority; Subjects are not to tranſgreſs the Landmarks of their Neighbours; they are Slaves to Laws, and confin'd to the inheritance and patrimony of their Fathers; the <hi>Prince</hi> alone hath liberty (with innocency more excuſable) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Territories. This enterprize then is not grounded on ſlender conſiderations, that I ſuſpend the poſſibility of the title of <hi>Conqueror</hi> to merit that of <hi>Protector;</hi> and though the great ſplendor of that high quality hath inflam'd the Illuſtrious Heroes of antiquity, and leſſened their dangers through their ambitious deſires, yet a Chriſtian Prince ought not ſo much to aim and attend on his ambition, as to incline to Juſtice: So then, that which was permitted to the Valour of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> is here defended by the courage of <hi>Emanuel.</hi> Our Policy excludes not any other particular virtues from our ſouls, but ſo, that in all our enterpriſes we ought to be equitable, and ſeverely to baniſh Injuſtice. Which Concluſion admitted, it was now much more proper to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour my <hi>Allies,</hi> then to endeavour a ſubjection of the <hi>Barbares:</hi> For as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96822:47"/>
it is with all men in generall, who live in a civill ſociety, that a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual interchange of good offices is neceſſary amongſt them; ſo it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> and their <hi>Allies;</hi> a common Intereſt obligeth them to oppoſe the Enemies of their Allies, as well as their own; and not to ſuffer thoſe with whom they have made an undoubted amity, to be devoured by the War, or to forſake them at the approach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and peril. You doubt not <hi>(Meneſais)</hi> but after the compleate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage of this mighty royall Navy, if I ſhould have received advice, that ſome of my Neighbour <hi>Princes</hi> had invaded me, I ſhould quickly have ſteered another courſe: And why then ſhall not the Intereſt of my Allies do the ſame thing, ſeeing that I am no leſſe obliged to their defence then to my own? The ſacred alliance which is amongſt <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> cannot be violated without injury to the rights and Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and it were moſt unjuſt in me to expect ſuccours from them to whom I did not intend any. Princes ought not to promiſe amity, and after to ſorfeit their ſacred words with fraud, and infidelity; and being able to relieve, they cannot (with honour) leave their friends to the fury of their enemies, and the haters of all Chriſtianity. It is true, <hi>it is a great glory to conquer, but it is more honourable and neceſſary to keep a royall promiſe inviolable and ſacred. It is no diſhonour to attempt a Conquest, though it be not obtained: But a man can never violate his word and promiſe without the blemiſh of baſeneſs and falſhood; an act ſo unworthy of a Prince, that he ought to deteſt it above all things.</hi> For if he faile in his Fidelity to his Allies; what doth he but teach his Subjects to be as falſe and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as himſelf? And I confeſſe as Juſtice pleads with me for the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> ſo Generoſitie and Nobleneſſe prevails with mee to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to their humble requeſts: For (with your good favour) tell me with what reſolution could our Army march to ſubdue ſtrangers, if we had refuſed aſſiſtance where there was ſo great neceſsity of ayd, and ſuch eminent peril of the ruin of our friends? Should it be ſaid, that I marched further from an Enemy into other parts, becauſe hee came nearer towards our Allies? Or that I durſt not engage my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as if thoſe of the Enemyes were too formidable? Am I a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at ſuch diſtance that I cannot ſuccour ſpeedily in the acceſſe of their greateſt calamities? Doth it concern me, that I endeavour to pillage <hi>Alcaſſarquiber</hi> becauſe <hi>Bajazet</hi> intends to pillage <hi>Venice</hi> with his army? all theſe arguments are unworthy a <hi>Chriſtian Prince,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires after the quality of Juſtice, as well as that of Conqueror. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minds are not onely obliged to endeavour the Victories of Towns, Provinces, and Kingdomes, but they are likewiſe to gain the peoples hearts, and thereby obtain an univerſall approbation, which will convert tumults to concords, and raiſe glorious acclamations reſounding to their honour who know to merit them.</hi> And what action doe you imagine can be ſo capable to render a <hi>Crown</hi> immortall, as that which relieves a <hi>Republick of Chriſtians</hi> terrified with an army of more then <hi>one hundred thouſand Turks?</hi> Upon all other occaſions, when a Prince is engaged in War, he cannot expect honour and commendations from all the World: For as for thoſe whom hee invadeth, they will ſtile him an Uſurper, his neighbour Princes will cenſure his ambition, and rather be ſpectators of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, then be ſupplyers; and according to event they will ſpeak in fear or flattery. But in ſuch an action as this, no ill cenſure can ſucceed. Thoſe who are intereſted will eſtimate us as their <hi>Liberators;</hi> other
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96822:48"/>
                  <hi>Kings</hi> wil behold us far more eminent for our <hi>fortune,</hi> or more ſurpaſſant for our <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>valour:</hi> &amp; <hi>Bajazet</hi> himſelf (though an Enemy) cannot leſſe eſteem us. And truly to relieve the oppreſſed and feeble reſiſtants, being our Allies, is a far more generous action, then to abaſe a puiſſant and formidable enemy. Is it not true <hi>(Meneſais)</hi> that if in your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney you ſhall meet with one man aſſaulted by three or four, and that he ſhould cry out for your aſſiſtance (though he were a ſtranger, and your buſineſs urgent) could you refuſe to ſtay, or aſſiſt him? ought not the ſame nobleneſſe of mind be in a <hi>King</hi> which is uſuall in every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon out of the rules of humanity, and naturall compaſſion? Should I then leave mine Allies in their extremity to be a prey to the fury of an Enemy? This undertaking preſents a double reward to the noble undertaker; the one is, ſuſtentation of the feeble; the other is, the ſuppreſſion of the mighty: And (if heaven pleaſe) he ſhall repel the one with as much ſhame, as gain of glory to his own endeavours. I may adde moreover, that <hi>Juſtice and Generoſity united, are the moſt Royall virtues, the ſureſt ſupporters, and the wiſeſt Counſellors of a King.</hi> Some other Rules of Policy may pretend to be the ſole guides, as inſtructing them whether to make Peace or War, and to give orders to all their actions. It is confeſt that Policy is the royall Science, and compaſſeth her ends in great undertakings; but her Maxims are dangerous for them who have not righteous intentions. Policy is like love, which changeth her form according to their receptions who entertain her. <hi>She proves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in a jealous preoccupated spirit, ſhe becomes furious in the violent, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth baſe and cowardly in a perſon of leſſe intereſt, but ſhe is alwaies reaſonable in a noble &amp; generous mind. In whatſoever dreſs ſhe's found, ſhe courteth her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, and flatters thoſe with whom ſhe conſulteth to give a colour and varniſh to her deſigns.</hi> Yet in this conjuncture of affairs ſhe cannot diſſwade me from aiding the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, were they ruined, what advantage ſhould I get, or what danger incur? I know well the <hi>Turks</hi> are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote in diſtance, that I cannot rationally fear the enemies Invaſion can extend as far as my Kingdom. But it is the Intereſt of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes to repell the Forces of the Turk, who is already too puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant over Chriſtendom; and all Kings ought deeply to reſent an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Forces, who is daily inriched with the ſpoyles and plunder of Chriſtians: His unlimited ambition aiming at the deſtruction of all Kingdomes, and aſpiring to eſtabliſh an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Empire and Monarchy. It is not onely for the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſakes that mine armies ſhall march, but as I look on their Enemy as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of all the Chriſtian world. If all Princes were ſo prudent as they ought to be, they would not think that the <hi>Venetians</hi> were firſt undertaken, becauſe they were more hateful to the Turks then others, but it is to make a paſſage by them to further extenſions, to leave no enemy in the rear to march after, and ſo to flank or offend. In this deſign then all other Chriſtian Kings have their common Intereſt, though I (at preſent) be more active, and more ready in preparation then others. You know <hi>(Meneſais)</hi> when Kings make great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for War, they alarum their neighbour Princes to arms, leſt they ſhould be ſurpriſed, leſt the publick Faith ſhould not prove ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puiſſant to aſſure and to remove all fears and jealouſies. It being ſo then that all Chriſtian Princes know how that <hi>Bajazet</hi> hath levied an army of 100000 <hi>men,</hi> why have they not armed themſelves as well as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96822:48"/>
he for their Conſervation? If they can be ſo ſtupid as to be falſe to their <hi>Allies,</hi> or careleſſe of their brethren and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In the meane time I ſhall oppoſe theſe numerous Forces, though I march alone: And by conſequence I alone ſhall be charged with the ſucceſſe of this Warre: Who, had I refuſed, the <hi>Venetians</hi> might have been juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by other Princes, who ſhadowing their excuſes with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and accuſations of their neighbours might ſay, had they been in the ſame poſture as I, they would have done no leſſe. Now as <hi>the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Warre is ever ambiguous,</hi> if in ſtead of Conquering <hi>Barbary,</hi> I ſhould miſcarry in this enterpriſe, with what Clouds of ſhame ſhall I be obſcured? From the Honour of a <hi>Conqueror</hi> I may be reduced to be a <hi>Priſoner.</hi> From the hopes of being a <hi>Protector</hi> I may be rendred a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and inſtead of the Garland of Glory be rewarded with the brand of infamie; my Friends and mine Enemies might equally ſcorn me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I provoked the one and the other, my diſcretion would be in queſtion, preferring an uncertain before an aſſured path to true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For there is this infallible difference betwixt the deſignes of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> and aſſiſtance to <hi>Allies:</hi> The firſt cannot be glorious but with a victorious ſucceſſe of VVarre, but the other of it ſelf is natively ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and from thence ſprings a Fountain of reputation, though the event prove not ſo Fortunate. I know well that all who promiſe to be <hi>Protectors</hi> of their <hi>Allies,</hi> are not ever their <hi>Liberators</hi> in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. But though their <hi>Allies</hi> be Vanquiſhed, and thoſe who ſtrive to aſſiſt them, yet their misfortune is honorable, and that reward fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes their memory, that they ſhare of their danger onely, not of their diſgrace. And though the <hi>Allies</hi> and their aſſiſtants have a joynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, their miſeries may deprive them of their lives or liberties; but they are ſtill faithfull friends, having gained a generous reputation in uſing their beſt and utmoſt endeavours. If then I preferre my March to <hi>Venice,</hi> before my voyage to <hi>Affrica,</hi> I have not done leſſe hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for if I ſhould have been invaded by mine Enemies, of whom ſhould I have expected ſuccours in the like condition? Of what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might this reſolution have proved? If I had forſaken the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and expoſed to the fury of the <hi>Turks,</hi> thoſe who are a people that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the ſame <hi>God</hi> with us; And at the feet of his Altars might powre out innocent imprecations againſt us for our refuſall; What might my ſubjects think if I ſhould not compaſſionate their Condition? Might not they object that if the intereſt of Religion did not oblige me to my duty, that they might ſhake off theirs out of the ſame reſpect? It might be that ſome of our <hi>Provinces</hi> poſſeſſed with <hi>Rebellion,</hi> might take example from my ſelfe, and neglect and forſake me as I might my <hi>Allies.</hi> Perhaps my deſign of Conqueſt of other Countries might prove the occaſion of loſing mine own Royall Inheritance, and the abandoning my Allies in their extremities, and a diſhonourable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the lawes of Nations, might raiſe a provocation in all neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes againſt my perſon; And (my abſence removing their fears) might perſwade them to invade a part of (if not all) my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For <hi>when Kings do leavy Armies, and intend to wage War, they alwaies frame a pretence and reaſon for their martiall Comportments, in which deſign common Policy never faileth, and where envy is the Counſellor, infinite malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences are never wanting.</hi> This rightly conſidered, a ſage previſion finds it better to commit a hundred things unprofitable, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96822:49"/>
one act injurious and offenſive to an Equall. And 'tis true, the removall of an injurious pretence from a Prince, might occaſion the diverſion of an Army, which might have been leavied againſt thoſe who had not kept Faith with their Allies. <hi>All the great revolutions which have arrived in Kingdoms and Empires, have had but petty and ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencements. And uncertain Policy hath no ſuch grounded rules as to aſſure any ſecurity;</hi> For when ſhe hath laboured moſt, and promiſed to warrant an eſtate from a puiſſant enemie, and that nothing without, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhould trouble or ſhake the foundations of a Kingdom; wee finde <hi>from what little ſparks mighty flames have thriven.</hi> Perhaps the love of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a ſubject of a mean quality made a favourite, or ſome ſharpe reſentment, ſometimes a miſpriſion or miſtake hath ſet diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Nobles; that diſſention hath generated hatred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, that envy hath introduced revolt, theſe revolts leavied Armes, and made Warre, and that Warre deſtroyed the <hi>Kingdom. That is,</hi> then, <hi>true Policy, and infallible, when all things are foreſeen, that need Prevention.</hi> But to ſpeak clearly, ſuch an impoſſibility can never arrive, and the profoundeſt Polititian cannot prevent the Contingency of ſtrange Events. In obſervation then to what hath been preſuppoſed, I have judged it neceſſary to wave my Voyage into <hi>Barbary,</hi> and to march towards <hi>Venice:</hi> The undertaking of this latter enterpriſe preſents no greater inconvenience then a deferring of our deſign for <hi>Affrick</hi> for ſome farther time: and the entertaining of this occaſion may happily ſecure my own Dominions from a Civill Warre, or forraign invaſion.

But as for him whoſe deſignes are to be a Protector of his Allies, he hath the Reines in his own power, he dependeth on his own will, to attain his undoubted renown. He who is ſtiled a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, perhaps may acquire the Epithets of hardy, valiant, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; But he who hath the name of a protector, enjoyes not onely theſe former qualities, but theſe are added that he is juſt, faithfull to his Allies, noble and generous. Now if the difficulty of undertaking giveth addition to glory, in any enterpriſe; Then certainly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of reliefe in ſo eminent danger cannot but be an act of moſt tranſcendent honour. At preſent we onely intend Preſervation to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and to encounter with a mighty Army of <hi>Turks,</hi> and we may poſſibly get this advantage, having firſt ſubdued our own ambition to vanquiſh this inſolent Enemy, or at leaſt be able to impede the deſignes of his new Conqueſt. The honour which we ſhall gain, will be ſo clear and pure, as not to appear corrupted with the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of ſelf intereſt before the Peoples eyes. If we ſhall not render the <hi>Turks</hi> Priſoners, we ſhall be happy in preſerving our Allies from being their ſlaves; If we cannot beautifie the ſacred Altars, we ſhall repute our ſelves bleſt if we can defend them from the Turkiſh fury; and equally pleaſe our ambition, and be fully ſatisfied, though we be not Conquerors in <hi>Africa,</hi> to be Protectors in <hi>Europe</hi> of the innocency and vertue of our Allies and our Religion. Theſe are honours to which we may lawfully pretend; men in this noble endeavour are bound to acknowledge to us the means of their Preſervation: Fathers will have their Children, and husbands their Wives protected in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Modeſty; our memory and fame will grow up with the little infants, who by this deliverance, will be taught to continue the honour of their liberator to poſterity: and by a diſcharge from ſuch evills ſtill prove firmer <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and more faithfully hate the ſinnes and errrors of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> As for <hi>Conquerors</hi> they <hi>gain glory, but never without effuſion of much innocent blood, their Charriots of Triumph are a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and thronged with thoſe who are more miſerable, then criminous;</hi> but in this deſign our Souldiers draw no bloud, but from the veines of <hi>Infidells,</hi> and from thoſe who are the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Enemies; and as for our <hi>honour</hi> in this action, it is as equally without ſpot as Competition.

If <hi>Iuſtice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone commanded me, I ought to undertake it for her ſake; For Kings owe that duty to all the World, as well as to their own ſubjects. <hi>Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> is another promoter of this action in my Soul, which if I ſhould not obſerve, I deſerved not the name and title of a <hi>Prince.</hi> If I incline to <hi>Policy</hi> or ſecret <hi>Counſells</hi> of my perſwaders; and if I ſubmit to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration which ſo inflameth mine own mind, the Beams of honour lead me to this reliefe, which no <hi>Princes</hi> could refuſe but with an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection to the royall Dignity: <hi>Juſtice, Generoſity, Policy,</hi> and <hi>Renown,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the four wheeles which carry my reſolution; Seeing the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the ſecond encourageth, the third Counſelleth, and the fourth inflameth; we cannot but ſubmit to their united operations, believing we cannot fail, guided by their Conduct and Counſells.

This action of his was more glorious then his Throne, and more precious then the golden Scepter which he bore: The Diademes of Imperiall Crownes are not ſo sparkling as the Rayes of this illustrious action: The Purple, and magnificent garment Princes wear, repreſent not perfect Majesty without their inclinations to imitate ſo great a Prince, who hath appeared in this not far ſhort of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar.</hi> The high reputation of Conquerors exceedeth not the generoſity of an equitable and moderate Prince, who is as glorious in the relief of his Allies, as if mounted on the chair of the higheſt Triumphs. And ſometimes to refuſe ſuch glorious offers doth not relliſh leſſe of true renown, then eminently to Triumph. To preſerve ones friends, is no leſſe prudence and honour then to deſtroy the Enemy. And this is a Maxime as ſage as ſound. <hi>Rome</hi> (which this Prince obſerved) gave freely a Crown to him who preſerved one <hi>Roman</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, and erected many Statues, and honoured him with many thouſand Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies. To him (I ſay) who honourably preſerved the Republick, and defended his Allies by his generous actions, in preferring them above his proper Intereſt. This is advice fit for Princes, becauſe thoſe who ſeem to be above the Laws, eaſily beleeve they are not obliged by any; and it is good to intimate to them (from time to time) that they are men as well as Princes; and if their condition do exempt them from what they preſcribe to others.

Some Princes have commanded that they ſhould be daily remembred with that ſaying, <hi>Souviene toy que tu es mortel,</hi> least they ſhould forget it through the splendor of their ſtate. 'Tis true, <hi>Kings are to be diſcourſed with moſt properly in ſoft and ſilken termes; and imperious language ſounds not well in Soveraigns ears; the ſweetneſs of perſwaſions are of greater force then boyſterous ſpeeches: Yet Thunder and Lightning is welcome when it changeth the corrupted air.</hi> In curing the deſperate wounds of Princes, the Chirurgeon obſcures the inſtrument of Iron which muſt open and heal, gives it a perfume which may be more pleaſant, ſugars and clarifies the remedy to make it more conducible, and leſſe ſharp and afflictive to the Patient. When Philoſophers ſtudy Morality they finde Virtue inviron'd with Prickles and Thornes, ſcarce to be ſaluted without danger. But when they conduct vertue to Court, or would lead her into Princely Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, ſhe is adorned with all variety of rich accoutrements to make her more lovely in the eyes of Majesty.

If my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were elder, I ſhould leſſe ſuſpect his power, and more confide in his affections. As for his Inclination which may be ſweet and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Thoſe qualities doe render him more formidable: With theſe ſhapes of affability and courtſhip, he will more eaſily ſuborn my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and reign more puiſſantly in their hearts by his complacencie then by his gifts, his ſolicitations, or expenſe of treaſure. The fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my humor, and the ſweetneſſe of his comportment will cauſe thoſe to love him who fear me, and gladly to forſake ſo ſevere a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, to follow, and obey ſo complacent, and courteous a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and if there be occaſion, I am not to doubt of their reſolution to a Revolt, when they are poſſeſſed with ſome expectation, and hopes of him, as a fit Succeſſor, and are ſo preſently inchanted with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream civilities. As for that other quality, his being <hi>Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> of all my Armies, it is a relation and capacity wherein I may not leaſt ſuſpect him: For then when he was but <hi>ſixteen years of age,</hi> after the Battaile of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſlain, he was chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received <hi>Generall</hi> to that victorious Army, with the unanimous applauſe of the greateſt officers, who ſo joyfully ſubmitting to him as their chief, being ſo young, and after the death of ſo noble and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a Commander, made me preſently conclude that he was born to be fortunate, and great: And ſince his advancement to bee Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, doe you not ſee how delightfully the Souldiers flock and follow after him? Doe they not purſue all occaſions to manifeſt their Valour for his honour, and daily thirſt after the happy hours of his fortunate conduct? He hath (ſince his commands) not onely beaten the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> made the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> to fly to <hi>Rochell,</hi> and forced the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96822:53"/>
at <hi>Anbeterre</hi> and <hi>Muridan;</hi> The ſecond battaile which he gained, whereby he reduced many places in <hi>Poitou, Saintogne,</hi> and <hi>Angoulmois;</hi> and thoſe other noble acquiſitions even to the taking of Saint <hi>John de Angelo.</hi> All theſe circumſtances have peſwaded me to a ſuſpition, and to more ſtricter obſervations of his waies. Theſe fortunate events might inflame his expectations to ſublime thoughts of commanding all: And as ſometimes the ſtrength of force ſurmounts, and is prevalent above the Lawes of Nature, and the rights of birth, his thoughts may be tranſported beyond thoſe of a ſubject, he might conceit himſelf to have as good a Title to a great part of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> had to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> when he commanded there with his Army. And it is more then probable, his ambition will hardly admit of this difference, that the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who affected great <hi>Alexanders</hi> Conqueſts, were his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But the French who had compaſſed theſe illuſtious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ſervice of their Generall, were not his but my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whilſt I lived and reigned. As to that relation, wherein you tell me that he ruleth the <hi>Queen</hi> my <hi>Mother</hi> as he pleaſeth; To that I ſhall reply, tis true, the <hi>Queen</hi> my <hi>Mother</hi> hath great paſſion for my <hi>Brother,</hi> and it may be ſhe is ſo indulgent in her love to him, that it tendeth much to my prejudice. The honour and reſpect which I owe to her, (being her Son) and the quality of her Regency of <hi>France</hi> which ſhe ſo bravely performed, commands me, that I dare not preſume to examine ſeverely that Article, though I apprehend (ſometimes) that my Mother preferrs my younger brother to more degrees of affection; yet I am to be pardoned if I be not ſilent in that point, nor eaſily raze it out of my memory. You know when the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> beſeiged St. <hi>John de Angelo,</hi> he met with more difficulty then he expected, and the affairs were ſo managed, that they rather threatned diſgrace then honour. But the <hi>Queen</hi> my <hi>Mother</hi> fearing (in this occaſion) leaſt this action ſhould reflect with a diſreputation upon my brother, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe with ſome diſadvantage all his former Victories, commanded me to march and raiſe the Seidge, by which accident I became liable to the diſhonour of that unſuccesful attempt. I leave you then to judge, whether I may more rationally confide in him, or whether I ought not the more to ſuſpect him, ſince he hath of his party not only the greateſt of the Commanders and Captaines, but even a Princeſſe whoſe honour and juſtice are ſo equally admired. But (as I ſaid) I muſt not ſcrue up this ſtring too high, nor examine this point too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly: For the <hi>Queen</hi> is my <hi>Mother,</hi> as well as ſhe was <hi>Regent,</hi> and therefore of a higher degree, then to be treated as an ordinary ſubject; And whatſoever arrives, I ſhall be more glorious (let her uſe me as ſhe pleaſe) in the effects of any of her deſignes; then if by a diſreſpective preparation I ſhould preſume openly to oppoſe her. But there is a midde way (which I chooſe to walke in) ſo even and inoffenſive, as ſhall give her no pretence to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, and yet ſhall remove all obſtacles which can deprive me of her affection. The Courting and Carreſſing of the people, if free (poſſibly) from ſecret ambition, is not onely tollerable but comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; but when a young <hi>Prince</hi> is compliant and affable, and ſtudies to winne and pleaſe, thoſe endeavours being imployed to his equals, and inferiors as fellow ſubjects, with as much or more obſervation, then to his Soveraigne, can it be that one of his Condition
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96822:53"/>
would make himſelf ſo much a ſlave to ſuch perſons, but upon deſign thereby to become their King? Certainly if this were not his aime, he would eſteem it far more conducing to his advantages to court his Soveraign upon whom he depends; Then thus to fawn upon his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. Liberality, on ſuch anoccaſion is but a Mercenary vertue; her giving is rather a ſowing in expectation of an Harveſt, which may make a return with uſury: And it is theſe hopes which makes her Prodigall, who, upon another ſcore, would have given nothing. In the conſultation then of all theſe conſiderations that the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou</hi> is my Brother, that he is young, and Generall of my Armies, that his inclinations are affable and ſweet, that the <hi>Queen</hi> my <hi>Mother</hi> ſo highly favours him, and that he hath no other buſineſſe but to gain the hearts of thoſe who addreſſe to him; It were imprudence not to be jealous of him: Yet all theſe reaſons and conjectures ſeem weak and feeble in compariſon of what I ſhall farther add. The <hi>Queen</hi> is of that diſpoſition, that ſhe juſtifies all others before me, ſhe authoriſeth all to have ſuſpitions on me; She diſcovers the moſt concealed ſecrets of my truſt to the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and them of his faction; ſhe accuſeth and convinceth the cleareſt reaſons, and will not admit of truth it ſelf to oppoſe her pleaſure. I have read in hiſtory that an old wiſe Ruſtick who confined his ambition within the Walls and Palliſadoes of his Garden, received a Crown from <hi>Alexander</hi> with ſome regrett, and ſhew of <hi>Melancholly:</hi> And ſome Philoſophers have not thought a <hi>Crown</hi> worthy the lifting up to their heads: But I never yet read that a young Prince, whoſe inclinations are wholly bent to Gallantry, and to pleaſure (rather then towards morality) would receive a Crown with regret or diſcontent. When one preſenteth me with the newes of a Town ſurrendred, or a battail won; my preſents were uſually Chaines of Gold to thoſe who bring ſuch happy tydings: And yet the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> hath ſcarce a common Civility for them, who bring him the aſſurance and tidings of a Crown and Kingdom; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he is ambitious of being reputed the moſt civill and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeant Prince of all the world: Nay when it was told him that <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was dead, and conſequently that he might aſpire and pretend to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> he diſcovered more tears in his eyes for the death of <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> then if he had received the ſame newes of me: what varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoughts then may not hourly ſuggeſt to me ſtrange apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? May I not think that he who receives ſuch a Kingdom with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, aimes at one more glorious? And for what other reaſon can it be, that the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> ſhould be inconſiderable? I do not think he can eaſily compaſſe the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> his friends are not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, as to abuſe <hi>Philip the ſecond</hi> to ſerve him and his deſign; as for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>Illuſtrious Queen Elizabeth,</hi> that Kingdome is as equally impoſſible; For the <hi>Queen</hi> will not marry but dye a Virgin. What reaſon can there be then alleaged, why my brother ſhould refuſe to be a <hi>King,</hi> unleſſe he hoped and expects my death, which might prove his paſſage to a more glorious Throne? And all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I diſcern not his way, it is moſt evident, his deſign is laid to this haughty pitch. That mighty faction which I have formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, will treat and agitate profoundly for his black intereſt and criminall expectations. His name is great, being of the Royall Family, his party proportionable to their great occaſions: He
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96822:54"/>
watcheth all advantages, he expects the fruits of his dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and may plead no inclinations of his own, but my ſubjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to ſerve me. To all this the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> preſumes he is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the <hi>Queens</hi> cordiall wiſhes, and his extremity of hatred to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party will occaſion a War, that War keep up his intereſt with the greateſt Officers of the Army, and Grandees of the Kingdom, and theſe intereſts ſtill increaſe his power. I cannot deny but thoſe of whom I ſpeak in their Qualities merit not a Kingdom, but though Fortune hath not given it them, their ambition thirſteth after it, who (without doubt) better deſerve exile, or a priſon, if it were ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to act ſuch an execution. But as his power cannot be ſhaken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ruining the Queen, and endangering the peace of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; I muſt not undertake what is impoſſible, knowing that my Brother hath the ſtrongeſt places of <hi>France</hi> under his command; and thoſe not ordinarily fortified, but reinforced with the affections of the people: It is neceſſary in this juncture to ſhew him a fair path, and to invite him with the temptation of a Crown, to remove him from his popular Authority; and ſo to weane the people from their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him to a more proper object.</p>
               <p>In this condition let <hi>Henry</hi> receive the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> and confined to ſo noble an <hi>Exile,</hi> act his royall part on that foundation. In his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion to that Throne we ſhall better eſtabliſh our own; and giving him Subjects, ſhall place guards about him, who ſhall aſſure us of his perſon, that he reigning more puiſſantly in <hi>Poland,</hi> we may reign more gloriouſly in <hi>France,</hi> and with more tranquillity. There is (moreover) this advantage in this deſign, that though I arme mine enemie, yet there is no fear that his weapons can reach me, nor trouble my ſafety at ſuch a diſtance. His Troopes may be diſcovered, if he deſign any irruption; and if we have any War, it is not likely to be on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of our Eſtates. Beſides, this Exile is ſo remote, that his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (left behind) dare not preſume to murmur, their complaints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to reach their Patron, or (at leaſt) he not near enough to revenge, or defend their diſcontents. Things thus examined, I found no way better to diſcharge my ſelf of this ſo near a danger; which if I had longer deferred, the wound might have been made too wide for any cure. <hi>Publickly to oppoſe by force thoſe whoſe crime is ſecret, is a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peoples hatred, and a leavying of Forces for mine enemies:</hi> So to act for them who would deſtroy me, or my Kingdome, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a War, which may not have an end in a ſhort time, and which may be fatall, and deſtructive to the whole, as well as ruin to my ſelf. To have immured this young <hi>Lion</hi> in a place where his fury might have prevailed with popular aid, had been a deſign too dangerous, and <hi>it is very difficult to find faithfull guards when he who is impriſoned is in a condition to be proclaimed and declared a lawfull King. Such a Fire as cannot be extinguiſht, is better to be diſperſed.</hi> It is then moſt rationall that the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> be made King of <hi>Poland,</hi> that I may be my ſelf. Surely he will never have the boldneſſe publickly to interpret that an unkindneſſe which deſerveth thanks. And as for thoſe who ſerve him, they dare not interpoſe in that, which appears ſo advantageous to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector: As for the Queen her ſelf, who is more ſubtile and prudent then not to diſſemble at leaſt a feigned joy, for that addition of a <hi>Crown</hi> to her Sonne, though it may inwardly cauſe ſome reluctancie and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96822:54"/>
griefe. What can then oppoſe a deſign ſo judiciouſly and prudently conſulted of? The greateſt objections (preſſed with ſevereſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) muſt needs be ſatisfied in the elevation of this young <hi>Prince</hi> to his Scepter; No aggravations can ſeduce the People, but that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour agreeth with his qualities, though never ſo noble. And as for you <hi>(Illuſtrious Prelate)</hi> conſider how in this Act the Kingdome is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from a ſecret Uſurper; your King is preſerved from a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and emulous Rivall and brother. The rootes of Rebellion are extirpated, peace is eſtabliſhed throughout all <hi>France,</hi> and never did any perſon extract a more illuſtrious and innocent revenge from ſo deep an injury: It being certain, that this is the firſt time that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge was ſatisfyed by the Coronation of an Enemy.</p>

The more nature and fortune hath obliged them; the more ambition diſuniteth and raiſeth ſuſpitions in their thoughts. It is true of ſoveraignty, as it is of the heart of man, where all wounds are mortall. When <hi>Tiberius</hi> came to the Empire, <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us that the Senate deſigned to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige their new <hi>Prince,</hi> by conferring a glorious title of honour on his mother <hi>Livia,</hi> and ſtiling her <hi>Mater Patriae:</hi> but this ſubtill and abſolute <hi>Polititian</hi> could not endure that title in his mother, but anſwered, that <hi>Honors in women are more properly to be moderated then augmented;</hi> And (as that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hiſtorian relates) that title procured her a Guard, which he appointed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to attend <hi>(Auguſtus</hi> being dead) least her Grandure ſhould leſſen and diminiſh his; And if <hi>Livia</hi> cauſed his restleſſneſſe, what perturbations did <hi>Agrippina</hi> increaſe; the great acclamations of the Souldiers as ſhe marched by the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> wounded him on the Banks of <hi>Tiber.</hi> And thoſe teſtimonies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which thoſe legions beſtowed on her engendred not only jealouſie, but hatred in his heart. Now if this cruell paſſion ſo tormented him, that he was ſo inraged by a woman, what might not ſhe have endeavoured to eternize the glory of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? he feared <hi>Germanicus</hi> (much more then the <hi>Barbars)</hi> he ſuſpected him too near to him in <hi>Almany,</hi> &amp; that he was not far enough from him in <hi>Aſia;</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> was not in ſuſpition alone as to cauſe his death.

To conclude, all examples of this kind eaſily demonſtrate, that the admiſſion of a companion in the Throne, is neither facile nor tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Wherefore, if we rightly examine whether a thing be good or ill, the thing it ſelf is to be ſcanned, not the effects which follow, which ordinarily arrive not but through ſtrange cauſes, for which there may be no merit for accuſation. Beſides, the apprehenſions of Kings, Princes, and great perſons, and their actions differing from others, deſerve a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reſpect. They are not alwaies regulated by a Law, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to an example, otherwiſe they muſt forfeit their reaſon, and their authority muſt intirely be deſtroyed.

As to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which concerned <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> they did not in their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aim at what was better, but what was greater. Their envy, and emulation was ſo high, that in the conteſtation they ſeemed not to contend ſo much for the Scepter, as to deſtroy each other; they had not ſpirits ſo moderated, as either joyntly, or ſucceſſively to reign and govern. And that which is ſaid of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> may be affirmed of <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> their Anceſtors; for <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> who e'r knows how they were born, foſtered, and educated, may eaſily judge, and have foreſeen the ill fortune which arrived to them both, the one brother dying a violent death, and the other living a hainous Fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide: For <hi>Augustus, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> ſeeing that they were joynt Competitors for Soveraignty, they could not but be harraſſed with unquiet perturbations: But as for <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> though the Government was interrupted with ſome errors in their Conſulſhip, yet it became not ſo unfortunate under thoſe two, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many other Princes. It is then neither unjuſt, nor impoſſible to admit of a companion, or aſſiſtant in Government. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> did nothing without reaſon, he was prudent, diſcreet, and virtuous, to ſuch a degree, that his example is ſufficient to juſtifie my reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Caracalla, Balbinus, Pupienus,</hi> and others, though they have differed in their judgements, yet have not contradicted my election and choice. And as for <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximianus,</hi> there was no circumſtance in their reign which yeelds not ſome aſſimulation to my purpoſe, their converſation was unanimous, they fought, vanquiſhed, conquered, and triumphed alike: And if any difference did ariſe, it was ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſmothered, as not to ſtir up any popular trouble, or ill reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And (for ought we know) when <hi>Diocleſian</hi> made choice of a private life, it was rather a voluntarie election to retiredneſſe, then any jealouſie of <hi>Maximianus,</hi> or any injury from ſo faithfull a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league. Beſides, in this eminent, and great receſsion from the Crown, <hi>Maximian</hi> encountred with as much trouble as <hi>Diocleſian</hi> could with content and quiet. That which is ſaid of theſe Primitive Emperors, may be ſaid of others who ruled in <hi>Greece</hi> ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great transferred the Empire: <hi>Valentinian</hi> aſſociated his brother <hi>Valens,</hi> and afterwards his ſon <hi>Gratian,</hi> who in a ſucceſsion continued the ſame Grace with <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and he to his children <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius;</hi> and when <hi>Honorius</hi> raigned in chief alone, he nominated <hi>Conſtantius</hi> for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96822:56"/>
his Colleague in the Empire. Thus <hi>Juſtinus</hi> made choice of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> his Nephew, and many others of Princely quality propoſed this way as beſt for themſelves, and ſubjects. Yet if all the Reignes of theſe ſeverall Princes were not ſo fortunate, the evill conſequents and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are not to reflect on my deſign. The ſame misfortunes have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them who have governed Empires, ſolely, and without a companion, as it appears too evidently in the ſaid Reigns of <hi>Caligula, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> and many others who have been as wicked as great. But as I ſaid before, it is not by illuſtration or examples, but ſence of reaſon that I ſhall ſupport my undertakings. Did I rely on the precedents of Hiſtory, the Greeks can plentifully furniſh me with examples both great and illuſtrious. In <hi>Sparta,</hi> where Morality and Policy ſeemed to have their birth, and whoſe rules may guide all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the command was there legall and uſuall for two Kings to be of equall power. But becauſe examples prove nothing, let us liſten to reaſon which moſt juſtly challengeth obedience, and is the chiefeſt authority to govern Princely actions: And now let us ſee whether ſhe doth not counſel me to place my brother with me in the throne, which rational men muſt needs confeſſe an act of greateſt Prudence, if it tend to the repoſe and ſafety of my people. To know this truth more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt conſider, that Monarchy is obvious to many dangerous Concomitants; he who is higheſt in power, is not alwaies fitteſt for the diſcharge of the greateſt imployments. Kings, though they are poſſeſſors of honour, they are not alwaies friends to virtue, and often ſhare in vice more deeply then any of their ſubjects. And they who finde themſelves ranked in that high condition, that they can doe what they will, (it is to be feared) will not alwaies doe what they ought. The firſt motions of a provoked King, or of a Prince leſſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ought to be feared, as much as lightning. His rage and wrath are equally terrible; he no ſooner hates, but is on fire with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he is no ſooner diſpleaſed, but ſpeedily puniſheth all whom he ſuſpecteth to diſpleaſe him: Innocency cannot ſtop his fury, his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions are as ſwift as his thoughts, his paſſion is ſometimes ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it runneth headlong into a precipitation, where Reaſon is not admitted to plead, nor Juſtice adminiſtred, but Clemency utterly forgotten. 'Tis true, a Kingdom may be unfortunate where two Princes are equally vitious, but if the one have inclinations to virtue, they wil prevent the errors and defaults of ſociall miſtakes: But it is rare in Nature to ſee two men (much leſs two Princes) of the ſame humours and tempers, yet ſome advantage may bee extracted out of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their vices: If one be lazie and idle, it may reſtrain the choler, and impatience of the other; the coldneſſe of the one may ſerve to correct the hot and paſſionate humour of his companion. And hee who is too ſlow may equally be quickened by him who is ſuperactive and vigorous: And why ſhould not that noble emulation which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveneth skilfull Artiſts, and hath made great perſons Competitors in Virtues, cauſe Kings and Princes more eminent in their Office and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? From ſuch an innocent Conteſtation may ariſe the ſecure reſult of peace to a Kingdome, greater Glory to the State, abundant plenty and happineſſe to the People. For when a King makes uſe of his Counſellors, which may be ſage, faithfull and wiſe, yet they are of no other uſe to him then books are to private ſubjects, he conſults
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96822:57"/>
with them but when he pleaſeth, admits no conference, but when hee calleth, believeth as he liketh, and acteth nothing but what agreeth with his inclination, and perhaps no part of that which hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in advice; But in this united Government, affaires are not ſo tranſacted. Great reſolves ought to be at leaſt in the Conſultations of two, and the very time of debate may contribute ſome more exact advantage: The diverſity of their opinions and apprehenſions may ſerve to produce a more perfect diſcuſſion: And theſe conſiderations (if they effect not a happy concluſion) they may at leaſt prevent a precipitation and ruine to the State, and to preſerve the Kingdome from a Forraign invaſion, or from the combuſtion and broiles of Civil War, which are not eaſily quieted without generall deſtructions. Weigh the conveniencies with the dangers of two equall in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the condition will be more ſecure, either in Peace or War. In a War the one may govern with Counſell, the other as Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Army: The one in the Court derive Juſtice to the People, the other in the Camp order Martiall affaires to the incouragement of the Souldier, and terror of the Enemie. It being very difficult in ſuch a juncture of danger to preſerve the Civill part from acts of high injuſtice, and the Martiall from a deep reſentment of diſcontent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Conſpiracies are the common mothers of Civill Warres, which (like more Venomous and Putredinous Creatures generated farther from the Sun) have their birth, and are begotten in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Kings. Where, if the Beams of authority did ſhine, the Government would be more illuſtrious, and ſecure. Doe wee not ſee both in martiall and civill Government, both in the Camp and Courts of juſtice, that there are officers and Miniſters who in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the chiefe Commanders and Magiſtrate, are inveſted with their authority? and why may it not be as juſt and reaſonable, for a Prince, to have an aſſociate on the Throne? not inferior to him, but his equall, to this end, as not onely to adviſe and counſell, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be a ſharer of his vaſt imployments, and ſo thereby contribute an equall aſſiſtance to ſupport the weight of the Crown and Scepter.

But two Princes of equall intereſt in the ſame Crown, as two obedient Sonns in one mother are onely divided in their perſons, but not in their deſires; Their Glory is the ſame, their Throne, their Scepter, their Crown, their People, their united inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: And conſequently in this Community, they act with greater or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and proceed with greater Prudence, and enjoy not onely thoſe preheminencies which Monarchy is ſaid to have above other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, but even thoſe alſo which ſeem to render an Ariſtocracy advantagious.

Orb, where the authority is equall: The People though they have two Princes, yet they pay but one tribute, and if their judgements differ, the Government growes more ſecure, and the Princes and people in more ſafety by their diſſenting harmony.

And who ſhall ſuſpect me covetous after my having admitted my brother to the moyety of my Kingdome?

The eyes of all the Spectators broake up, as freſh Fountaines, over-ſwelling with tears of ſorrow; her very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if they did not weep, yet bluſht for ſhame, or waxt pale for griefe: The whole World felt an inundation and new floud of grief; ſorrow, and ſadneſſe poſſeſſed all who conſidered of this unfortunate event, except her ſelf encouraged by her innocency, ſupported by her Majeſtie; the Executioner himſelf (by his ſad countenance and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand) expreſſed the thoughts of his heart, his feares to ſtrike, his willingneſſe to ſave her. But in the end (Maugre all this univerſal compaſſion) her fair head fell to the ground, her ſcarlet blood trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from her veines, and her pulſes keeping no longer time, that beautifull Creature was rendred a dead Corpes. All theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pleade aloud in my breaſt for vengeance, and remove my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions utterly from the thoughts of pardon; The Queen my dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a ſoul ſo inured with afflictions, that ſhe was not terrified at the approach of death, nor amazed with the horrour of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was ready to ſurprize her with ſo ſtrong a violence, but even in that Agonie expreſſed her maternall thoughts and care of me, her generous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kindneſſe was ſuch to me, that her bitter afflictions could not obſtruct her tender affections to her Son.

In this Reſolution the Tombe of the Queen my Mother ſhould bee covered with the ſpoyls of her, and my cruell Enemies; and revenge ſhould be ſo full of blood as capable to inſpire terrour into all, who ſhould be ſpectators of that action.

Seeing that very hand which ſigned the Warrant for my honoured Mothers death, ſigned the Declaration which cauſed me to be proclaimed <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And as to this particular, I am as well bound to acknowledge and reward ſo high a favour, as to revenge ſo high an injury. I am not ignorant how that in this ſolemn action, that Queen gave me no more then what was mine own by a juſt inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſucceſſion; and that by her Royall Teſtament ſhe did no more then confirm what was declared to me by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight; yet if this <hi>Princeſs</hi> had pleaſed, ſhee might have declared that which might not have proved ſo advantagious to my expectations; ſhee might have objected, that my dear Mother the Queen had not been of the Religion imbraced in <hi>England,</hi> that though ſhe were a Queen, yet ſhe was a Stranger: And as for my ſelf, that I was the Son of her whom ſhe had cauſed to be deſtroyed: She might have cauſed her Father King <hi>Henry</hi> his Will to be cancelled &amp; annulled in <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſhe might have made another, and ſo have made a <hi>Favourite,</hi> or (if ſhe had pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) her people her Heir: Theſe difficulties might have obſtructed my aſcent, and paſſage to the <hi>Crown.</hi> Beſides, in this Act, if ſhe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and render ſatisfaction for her cruel error, yet ſhe manifeſted to all the world her reſentment and deteſtation of what ſhe had done, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencing her evill for good; and that having been <hi>circumvented</hi> by perſons as unjuſt as wicked, ſhe could elect, or follow better counſels; and if her jealouſie and malice had ſo far tranſported her, as to cauſe her to put my Royall <hi>Mother</hi> to death, it was not through thoſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſhe cauſed me her Sonne to be crowned. <hi>The ill humour of malice is not eaſily purged, nor quickly abandoned, it uſually reacheth not onely the perſon hated, but all coneomitants and relations near.</hi> Children and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred grow odious where a Parent is in deteſtation, and diſlike; this infection reacheth often to thoſe who are of a name; and (perhaps) ſtops not, but groweth epidemical, and produceth <hi>odium</hi> to a Nation. In the effects of this Queens proceedings I find other operations, the Queen expreſſeth no malice to my perſon, but rather on the contrary, ſtudies my honour, and endeavours my <hi>Coronation:</hi> And from hence I may moſt rationally conclude, that ſome ſecret maxim, and policy of State put a reſolution to that ſavage action; and conſequently if any duty binds me to forget her memory who cauſed my Mother to dye, or being the Son of ſo great a Queen; yet in all the rules of gratitude and prudence, I am bound to honour and reſpect her Nobleneſſe and great favours to me, whom ſhe adopted her Son, and Succeſſor to her Throne. But (may ſome one object) will it not be enough that you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize not her memory by prejudicial manifeſtoes to her honour and reputation, that you deſtroy not her Tomb, and that you permit her Aſhes to ſleep quietly in repoſe, but that you muſt continue your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

Authority in the hands of thoſe Miniſters which were her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and let them ſtil enjoy thoſe high offices wherein they exerciſed ſuch unheard of inhumanity, and in perſons, who made no ſcruple to put his Mother to death, who was heir aparent to the Crown, and could not fail (if he ſurvived) to be their ſoveraign? I confeſſe (my Lord) this reaſon is very ſtrong and ſound, and the anſwer that I ſhall make is no leſſe. I told you before ſhe acknowledged me to be her heir, and adopted me her Son, ſo that if I ſhould have revenged her actions with ſeverity, I ſhould moſt imprudently have preſumed to have cenſured the errors and deviations of my greateſt benefactor too bitterly, and like impious children, not onely have hated the vices, but the perſon of ſo great a <hi>Queen:</hi> But good Children, though they may hate unjuſt proceedings of their Parents, are not onely to forbear to puniſh, but are obliged to cover and conceal their errours and infirmities; To diſtinguiſh perfectly betwixt the crimes and the offendors, who (though never ſo Culpable) yet they can hold them worthy of honour and admiration. We may weep then bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the death of the Queen my Mother, and yet not proceed to an accuſation, or be ſevere to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſince the one was my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Nature and blood, &amp; the other made me a Son by her election when ſhe lived, and her Teſtament (when ſhe dyed) left me a Crown. Adoption (in all ages) hath been received as an action not to be violated, but with great injuſtice, and venerable hiſtory (in her antiquity) accompanies truth with her examples, and boldly tells us, that we owe an equall reſpect to thoſe who have adopted, as really as to thoſe who have given birth unto their Children. Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath conveyed <hi>Crownes</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> often to thoſe who have beene received and acknowledged by all the World in their Thrones and Soveraignty: and 'tis juſt to imagine that the choiceſt reſpect is ever due to the bounty of the Adopter. Parents who give us our Nativity, do not alwaies leave us an inheritance, which perhaps fortune or ill events have deprived from them; but thoſe who in their Election freely transferre their eſtates to us, their gift, as it is moſt admirable for its merit, ſo it ought to be more noble in acceptance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their voluntary choice may ſeem (if poſſible) to oblige us more, then our Naturall Parents. When firſt we come into the World, our Parents cannot but incline with tender affection unto us; the cauſe of that paſſionate and tender quality is a ſecret and myſtery concealed in our bloud, and riſeth from the inclinations of Nature, and yet that amity (how ſtrong ſoever) ſeemes not to differ much from the inſtinct of brutes, which naturally forceth their love and care towards their young ones. But in Adoption, there is another o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, there is an affection and choice, and that ſprings not rudely from ſence, but from the ſtrength of reaſons, where the Agent ſtrictly examines the object, before it fall in love with it, and dotes not with fancy, but with wiſdome, before it orders gifts or ſetleth poſſeſſions. In effect I am very certain, if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had not believed that my Soul had been more inclined to generoſity then revenge, ſhe would not have commended her Soveraignty and Crown to me, ſhe would not have acquitted all her favorites, and remitted her Scepter to my hands: there would not have been wanting perſons, neither within nor without the Kingdome, capable enough to ſupport or defend a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96822:62"/>
Scepter. We may reſolve then, if ſhe have called me to the <hi>Throne,</hi> it was becauſe ſhe judged me worthy, becauſe ſhe believed it appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, becauſe ſhe hoped I would render reſpect to her memory, and never violate or break thoſe bonds of love; and having regard to the Nobleneſſe of her favours towards me, I might be more firmly obliged from all thoughts of Revenge, in a matter clean out of the reach of reparation; and to which, oblivion and ſilence preſcribed the beſt remedies. Do not you believe (my Lord) if (at my comming to the Crown) I had filled the Priſons with the Grandees of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who were the chiefe Authors of my Mothers death, and had commended to the great Offices of the Kingdome ſuch ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had had no imployment or truſt under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> think you not that ſuch a ſuddaine alteration would have cauſed a ſpeedy generall Confuſion over all the Kingdom, and that at my firſt acceſſe to the Crown, I might ſeem to govern neither with ſafety nor honour? Should I have baniſhed thoſe bloudy Councellors, all the ſecrets and myſteries of State might have been diſcovered to forraign Princes; ſome of them were Miniſters, and imployed under King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> ſome under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp; others under Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was too wiſe to diſcharge thoſe whom ſhe judged fit for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in ſuch high imployments, though they had been prime parties in other factions, and violent Enemies againſt her perſon and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Yet (may one object) ſhe had no occaſion to think on Revenge, for thoſe who cauſed her Mother <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> to be put to death, and were Councellors and abettors of that act, they were dead long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began to Reign. But I ſhall eaſily anſwer to that: her actions were chiefly imployed for the conſervations of her ſelfe, for during the Reign of her Siſter Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe being unjuſtly ſuſpected to have been a conſpirator with thoſe who indeavoured to hinder the match with <hi>Spain;</hi> the Privy Councell concluded that ſhee deſerved the ſame deſtiny as <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and was in danger to have loſt her head; of which reſult in Councell, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant, waited with patience her better fortune; and after comming to the Crown, ſhe preſerved in memory their names, who had been ſuch deſperate Councellors againſt her, and in proceſſe of time, ſhe met with opportunities to revenge thoſe particular injuries; but upon new and freſh pretences. We are not then to be leſſe prudent then ſhe, whoſe dangers are as great, and buſineſſe as infinite: Beſides, in this action of her adoption, ſhe hath not onely aimed at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, but likewiſe at the repoſe and welfare of the people, ſo that her example guideth me in the paths of policy, and not to provoke and anger the Hornets neſts, when I may paſſe by quietly (without the leaſt murmuring) to my Crown. If then I ſhould be ſuperactive in ſuch a dangerous deſign, in whoſe fidelity and ſtrength might I confide? the number of the offendors is not ſo inconſiderable, as to perſwade me to dream that I can deſtroy them in a moment; and as for relation to themſelves, they are not onely acquainted with all myſteries of State; but they are likewiſe active Miniſters of ſtate in the chiefeſt places of the Kingdom, wherein as they have gained much Treaſure, ſo doubtleſſe they have obtained the hearts of the people, whereby a greater difficulty would ariſe if I ſhould conteſt raſhly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a party. Beſides to commence a Reign with a Civill War,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96822:63"/>
were to put the State and Kingdom in a capacity of deſolation, and ſuch a violent motion might invite the people to ſuch a hatred of me, that they might be hardly or never reconciled. If I had reſolved on this courſe, an hundred thouſand Innocent perſons might have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the deſign of a revenge of a few notorious Counſellors, this had been to undertake a great Evill for the bringing to effect a little good. If I ſhould exterminate all, whom I neither can, nor ought to love, ſuch a Revenge would produce but a feeble ſatisfaction. The <hi>blood o Kings is to pretious too be ſatisfied with the blood of Subjects,</hi> and all that I might do (in ſuch a re-encounter) might prove unworthy of a Royall Prince, who (as I ſaid before) honoureth Vertue and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality as well as Policy. <hi>The oblivion of injuries is an Act every way as noble as revenge:</hi> And in ſome caſes more glorious, principally then when one forgets not an outrage which he dares not revenge, onely becauſe his wiſdome judgeth it not fit. In this occaſion, I ought ſeriouſly to conſider that I do not onely receive the Scepter from the hands of a <hi>Woman,</hi> but from her who hath ſwayed it very gloriouſly, and hath raigned with honour, from a <hi>Lady</hi> who knew how to govern in peace, and vanquiſh in War, who could ſtop and prevent revolts as well as defend her ſelf from forraigners: And could force her ſubjects and her neighbours to fear her if they did not love her; and was ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as who triumphed over all who ever dared to oppoſe her. I leave you then to judge (my Lord Duke) if a Prince whom ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious a <hi>Queen</hi> called to the <hi>Throne,</hi> ſhould begin his Reign by the deſtruction of all, which ſhe had maturely eſtabliſhed. If I ſhould not give occaſion to all men to believe, that the Kingdom would be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily reduced to diſorders, and confuſion: And conſequently nothing to be expected but Ruine and deſolation. <hi>It is very important that the firſt Action of Princes ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Prince (if he be wiſe) will prepare his deſires not to revive the errors of his predeceſſors, nor to publiſh them, but to avoide them; and I could not but be guilty of injuſtice, if I ſhould dare to declare my ſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Judge of the Actions of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who ſuffered her wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to hearken to thoſe Counſellors, whom ſhe judged moſt able for her advice. Her Actions are not to be examined by any alive, but onely God in his Tribunall: the ſame obligation which ſhould have preſerved her from cauſing the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> to dye, forbiddeth me to intermeddle in the cenſure of her Royall proceedings. So that if I honour her memory, it was becauſe ſhe was a <hi>Queen,</hi> if I cover and hide her errors, it is becauſe ſhe made me her <hi>Adopted Son,</hi> if I continue her creature in the imployment of mine affairs, it is becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſafety and repoſe requires it. As for private injuries, as they are commonly betwixt the ſubjects, they are leſſe conſiderable with Princes. That famous <hi>Roman</hi> ſpoke not amiſs. Who ſaid, that <hi>Caeſars</hi> Erection of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Statues might better ſecure his own, and makes me apprehend (in this argument) that a confirmation of what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96822:63"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, may better ratifie what I ſhall eſtabliſh during my Reign, and that reſpect which I render to her memory, will be preſented to my perſon, and that I ſhall act nothing tending towards her honour, but what ſhall reflect to mine advantage. <hi>The change of great Officers in a Kingdome is little leſſe dangerous then the change of the Prince,</hi> which ought not to be without great and weighty conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Affaires of State ought not ſleightly to be managed,</hi> and if a <hi>maxime be reſolved on, it is more ſafe to proceed then diſhonourably to retreat.</hi> What Variety of dangers might I expoſe my ſelf and Kingdome to, if I ſhould think fit to baniſh thoſe who under the Queen have been the chiefe ſupporters and Governours of the State? It was not now long ſince the Reformation of Religion, at which time particular Intereſts (under the ſhapes of devout pretences) promoted thoſe terrible alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſhould I then think of dying <hi>Thames</hi> in bloud, as my <hi>Anceſtors</hi> had done not long before. I know, I cannot (with mine own honour) ſtain their reputation, but I may be defended if I onely remember their errours the better to avoid them; let us then think it fit, not to hearken to that bloudy Policy which eſtabliſheth not Thrones, but with the ruine of thoſe who ought to ſupport it; Who pardon none with Clemency, but injuſtly condemn the leaſt appearances of evill, and in ſatisfaction to their owne ambition, bear no reſpect to the higheſt quality of men, and reverence no ſex, no lawes, nor virtue her ſelfe: but (on the contrarie) let us hearken to that rationall <hi>Policy</hi> which foundeth Thrones and Crownes in the preſervation of the Grandees, which hath inclinations mercifully to pardon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not to an extremity; who can honour a Royall perſon in her Tombe, who can reverence Lawes and vertue to ſuch a degree, that he hath reſpect for her memory, who would not be ſatisfied, but with the bloud of his Mothers. I know ſome are of opinion, that a tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commencement prepares a way to a more ſecure Reign, but in my judgement (on this occaſion) that <hi>Policy</hi> is too deſperate; for if I pardon all who have offended, it is impoſſible but ſome party ſhould be affected with my generoſity; and if I ſhould puniſh all, I ſhould inevitably multiply mine Enemies, in their Kindred, in their Friends, and their dependencies; who (on ſuch a Provocative pretence) might raiſe an Army againſt me, which (in all probability) may prove no leſſe valiant then that ſacred bond of the <hi>Antients,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed, marched with greateſt violence to revenge the death of their Father, their Brothers, and their Friends. Yet you will anſwer me, things of greateſt difficulty (being effected) render the moſt abſolute duty. To that I reply, if they be injuſt, they ought not ſo much as to be attempted. <hi>True glory doth not ever attend the moſt hardy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and matters of greateſt difficultie.</hi> Moreover <hi>a Prince ought not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the lives of his ſubjects to the perill of death, whether it be in War or Peace, without great neceſſity,</hi> and prudent conſultation; for their blood is the moſt pretious and ſole Jewell, of which he ought to have the moſt exacteſt care, and hee had rather be ſparing and thrifty of that choiceſt Treaſure, then of all other of his Eſtate. For it is for that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, for which he ſhall render an accompt to him who gave him So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty: Who permits him not (above all other reſtraints) to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive and prodigall of his ſubjects blood. From the conſiderations of theſe reaſons, we incline to ſave the lives of our ſubjects, and (at our

firſt coming to the Crowne) rather choſe to court our enemies with the favour of Clemency, then to correct them with the Rod of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. On theſe grounds we ſhall render honour to the memory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; countermanding our naturall affection with <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>policy</hi> we will make the whole world confeſſe that we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to Reigne &amp; to enjoy our Princely Throne. Paſſing by then our Royall <hi>Mothers</hi> hearſe, let us look up towards the Throne, to which the Queen of <hi>England</hi> hath prepared and facilitated our aſcent; let us ſuſpend that tendernes of Soule which might diſſolve us with teares, and minde nothing more, but true nobleneſſe and generoſity, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, <hi>it belongeth to a Prince properly to pardon private injuries, and that it is a chiefe point of wiſdome not to loſe faire and fit occaſions;</hi> for in an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſeaſonable the Eſtate and publick good may be more highly advanced, and more ſolid Lawes ordained for their preſervation. In theſe reſolutions we embrace and welcome our preſent condition, concluding, that the generall repoſe of the Kingdome requires it, that mine owne glory conſents to it, and that my Soule is reſolved to maintaine, by a diſintereſſed vertue all that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who though ſhe tooke away the life of my Mother, commended a Crowne and Kingdome to me her Sonne.</p>

                  <p>IT is a question very Problematicall, and a controverſie much diſputed among Politicians, whether Clemency or Rigour be more neceſſary or profitable for Princes, and which of the two render their Kingdome more peacefull and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Both opinions want not ſtrong deſendors; ſince the World began, this queſtion hath not received a full reſolution: ſome affirme 'tis better to be loved then feared; others, that it is better to be feared then loved; each one (in the order of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention) fortifies his opinions and arguments; Rigour pretends to carry more of Majesty, Clemency hath a beame of glory, which ſeemeth to ſhine with more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; the one ſaies ſhe rules more ſecurely, the other that ſhe raignes more honourably; both ſtrive to beare away the <hi>Palme.</hi> A famous <hi>Politician</hi> feared not to ſay, that a <hi>Prince ought to puffe at that infamy which ſeemeth to ſtaine his reputation,</hi> becauſe he was cruell; the reaſon is, becauſe that quality renders his ſubjects more obedient. But (in my opinion) this is to ſet on fire the Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> When <hi>Machiavell</hi> broached this falſe propoſition he prepared an infamous memory to himſelfe, which his booke ſtill retaines. In effect, if glory be certainly the proper object of renowned princes, how can they ſupport infamy as a matter indifferent? And <hi>how can that Prince who Reigns without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour live a moment without danger?</hi> We cannot be ignorant of that antient ſentence, <hi>he who ſcornes his owne life may eaſily become Maſter of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers;</hi> and what can provoke a man to be more violent and deſperate, then the cruelty and injuſtice of him who commands in chiefe? <hi>Machiavell</hi> (the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Florentine) staide not at his first propoſition, but he ſaid, <hi>'twere good for a Prince to be loved &amp; feared; but ſeing it is a thing impoſſible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy both theſe paſſions at one time, in caſe either ſhould faile, it is much better to be feared then loved.</hi> Why ſhould that branded <hi>Polititian</hi> make feare and love impoſſible and inſeparable? could he be ignorant that all the vertues conſiſt in a concatenation, and are linked together?

<pb facs="tcp:96822:64"/>
are not incompatible though they ſeeme (almost) contrary. Did he never read in the <hi>holy Scriptures, that the feare of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdome?</hi> Or would he conclude thence this abominable conſequence, that becauſe one was obliged to feare God, that therefore it was impoſſible to love him? did he pretend to teach the world policy, and inſtead thereof produce Atheiſme? Did he not know that there is as well a filiall as a ſervill feare, which ſecond (though it be without Love) yet the first walkes with love hand in hand? This bewitching Spirit farther adds, Men love according to their owne pleaſure, but they feare according to the pleaſure of their Prince, who if judicious and wiſe, ought to rely cheerfully on that ſtrength which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Where doth <hi>Machiavill</hi> finde that the Prince is not intereſſed to gaine his peoples love aſwell as their feare? Are not graces and favours as well in his hands as the Sword of juſtice? and as for thoſe who feare him, are they utterly uncapable of his honour and reſpect? It is an antient precept, <hi>if thou wilt be beloved thou muſt be loving.</hi> This is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, an innocent Magicke and works infallibly as well betwixt Kings and ſubjects as private perſons. <hi>He who maketh freindſhip his treaſure may be liberall, when he pleaſeth without danger of profuſion.</hi> That Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was a groſſe flatterer and ſpake little truth, <hi>who ſtiled Hanniballs cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty a vertue,</hi> for in the ſame Argument he concluded Clemency a vice. The holy Scriptures warrant that <hi>Abyſſus Abyſſum invocat,</hi> and the Moraliſts tell us, that vices are link'd and chain'd together as well as vertues. To conclude then, this Juditious and wiſe <hi>King</hi> hath been the diſciple of a better Maſter, and learned his Chriſtian pollicy in a better Schooll; he well underſtood that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſaying of Antiquity, <hi>Ne quid nimis:</hi> and he had (doubtleſſe) read in the French Hiſtory, <hi>that it became not the King of France to revenge the quarrels of the Duke of Orleance,</hi> and likewiſe it conſiſted not with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the King of <hi>England</hi> to revenge the quarrells of the <hi>Queen of Scots,</hi> and therefore this moſt learned and prudent Prince did proceed judiciouſly, and the felicity of his raigne hath left an aſſured teſtimony of his wiſdome to all the World.

Who knowes not but that thoſe Souldiers who marched with me to Combat with the Tyrant might forſake me, if I (after the victory) became as horrid an oppreſſor as Richard.

Tis true to begin to reigne with ſuch reſolution, might have the reputation of hardy and glorious; but ſuch violence could not continue to any long duration of time; an entire age (at leaſt) might be required to corroborate (with all the arts of policy and power of Sword) a conqueſt of this kinde, and in concluſion (before the people would be reduced to obey without murmuring) a Prince would be conſtrained either to quit his Throne or looſe his life, and ſo ceaſe to be a King or be alive, before he could reape &amp; enjoy the fruits of his victories. Beſides (as the affaires of <hi>England</hi> ſtood) the Title of Conqueror might have proved too terrible to the people, and too dangerous to the Prince, at that ſeaſon, when (in all appearances) a quality more equitable was more requiſite, and it was not fit then to adminiſter the leaſt pretext to the people, that might exaſperate their clamourous humour to decry their Princes marching towards, and not as yet ſecurely ſeated in his Throne. <hi>It is</hi> alwaies <hi>an ill conjuncture when a ſubject renders his obeiſance to his Prince, not becauſe he conceives it his duty, but becauſe he dares doe no otherwiſe; a Prince is never well ſerved with ſuch forced devoires, nor the ſubject well ſatisfied with ſuch unpleaſant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> Perhaps (Noble <hi>Stanley)</hi> you will tell me yet that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way whereby I may more ſafely aſcend to the Throne, which policy doth not onely teach me to be ſecure, but morality perſwades me, is very heroick and noble; yes (faithfull <hi>Stanley)</hi> I know well if I eſpouſe Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I ſhall not need to ſet forth any declarations to manifeſt my Title and Right to the Crowne, ſhe being ſiſter and daughter to the late Royall Kings; the people look upon her as the true and undoubted heire of the kingdome, And marrying her after my vanquiſhing of the Tyrant who ſlew her Brothers, and uſurped

But, to ſpeak truth, I ſhould doubt extreamly if I made choice of this way, whether I might be eſteemed to have been as <hi>Prudent</hi> as I had been <hi>Fortunate,</hi> and whether I had not better have received my Crown from the hands of fortune in expectation of the continuance of her favours, rather then from the hands of a Woman; for (without doubt) it is a high degree of Fortune to be advanced to be a King, but I do not think it a thing ſo intirely deſireable to be the husband of a <hi>Queen,</hi> and (in my preſent apprehenſions) <hi>A Throne it ſelf is leſſe lovely, when I muſt approach unto it onely as the chiefeſt ſubject of her whom I muſt eſpouſe.</hi> In effect what obedience or loyallty may I expect from a people who ſhould not acknowledge me for their Soveraign? what ſubmiſſion might I expect, or honour from thoſe Nobles, who (were I dead) might have Capacity to be ſucceſſour to my relation and place; what reverence might I expect from my Children, who (if my Queene ſhould die) may become my Soveraign, and I their Subject? What (Noble <hi>Stanley)</hi> were it fit for me (having gained a Crown by my proweſſe and valour) to put my ſelf in ſuch a condition, that I might be forced to leave it? and if my Queen ſhould dye, to wear a mourning weed inſtead of a Royall Diademe? If I ſhould accept a Throne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe termes, I might be forced to depend upon mine own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Wills and pleaſure; Or (if I ſhould have none) an other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender might conteſt for my removall, and claim a right, and ſo I might be forced to obey whom I had commanded. No, no, this choice could not manifeſt abſolute power, nor could this borrowed fortune ſatisfie the Ambition of my Renown; this acceptation of Royall Authority might give me ſome ſplendor, but not render me truly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, theſe ſtreames ſeem to flow not from the Fountain of mine own, but anothers ſoveraignty. Kings ought to acknowledge none for their ſuperiours but God. I doe not conceive to be a husband and a ſubject to a Queen, are qualities compatible: In one relation the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is to be the head, in the other the wife; and if the Queen intend to render her ſelf, and husband truly happy, it is neceſſary that he be her King, and ſo her Chiefe; without which relations their condition can neither have true honour nor true content, and without them a Court were worſe then a Priſon, and ſoveraignty as little lovely as ſervitude. Now if she love her husband, and that by a moſt rare vertue, ſhee pleaſeth to condeſcend ſo farre, as to be ruled, and Reigne by him, the Subjects will preſently murmur and cry out, the King's a Tyrant to his <hi>Queen,</hi> and ſhe but his illuſtrious ſlave. Some will ſpeake too boldly, others complain judiciouſly, and ſome prevaile to perſwade too far with inſinuations and ſuggeſtions: When his Children ſhall grow up to age, they will not be free from flattering inſpirations to incline them to jealouſies and ſuſpitions againſt their Father; ſome will dare to inform them that he invades and uſurpes the Crown, that if the Queen dye, he will neglect and have no Paternall reſpects for them, and that therefore they rather ought to Court the People then
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96822:68"/>
honour their Father. Theſe ſuſpitions are too apt (ordinarily) to grow reciprocall, and are fixed too naturally near the Souls of ſuch eminent perſons. <hi>Difference in opinion breeds diſſention in reſolution, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention draweth on averſion, and averſion changeth love to hatred, and hatred breeds revolts, and revolts proclaime open Warre;</hi> ſo that by theſe degrees, diſcontents thrive to be irreconcileable: The people fall into greater troubles, and the Kingdom is made more ready for greater ruines and confuſions. Moreover do not you think, that whether the King have Children or not (if he be noble and generous) that he will prepare a party in his Kingdom to ſerve his affairs, on all occaſions; &amp; that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Queen be kind, ſweet, &amp; debonaire in his ſociety or not. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, how conceive you a Kingdom ſhould be governed without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errours in the conduct, when he muſt neceſſarily have his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt, beſides the publique, which cannot but evene and happen on many occaſions? for in order to the preſervation of his creatures, he will have cauſe ſometimes to diſſimulate in many things, ſomteimes hee will be forced to recompence with rewards, thoſe whoſe errours merit puniſhments, ſometimes to puniſh them who deſerve rather favours and rewards. Theſe accidents will make him endeavour to imbezell the treaſure of the State, and ſo make up Bankes for private uſes, or to make a Warre if there be cauſe. And as for peace, it can never be ſo perfectly eſtabliſhed in a Kingdome, but a King muſt ever politiquely ſuſpect either an inſurrection of a civill Warre at home, or an invaſion from abroad. And do you (brave <hi>Stanley)</hi> but imagine in what a pittifull condition is a King, who is not prepared and provided for ſuch contingences. Hee ceaſeth not onely to be a King, but loſes his honour and reputation, as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to rule. And of all the waies whereby Crownes and Kingdomes are loſt, as this is moſt far from remedy; So it is the moſt weake and farre from pitty. When a Prince (in a gallant reſiſtance) loſeth a pitch'd battail in the field; Fortune can force him to yeild, and make him to fly to ſome Aſyle; if the Cities and Towns of his Kingdome doe revolt, and his ſubjects treacherouſly forſake him, he may without all diſhonour ſeek for refuge, and ſearch out for ſuccour and ſupplies. And in his diſtreſſe, though the ſplendour of his glory be obſcured, it is not extinguiſhed; Though his Magnificence and power be abated, yet it is not diſſolved, nor ſo annihilated, but that he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with hopes, and aided by his friends and Allies, and ſo make a juſt VVarre, if he can obtaine meanes. Thoſe Princes from whom he implores ſuccours, may more poſſibly contribute their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, either through the concernment of their own intereſts, or their generoſity; and ſo though his misfortunes be great, yet his ruines are not abſolutely deſperate. But to acquit a Crown without more then one Combate, to loſe a Throne without a ſtroak, is a miſery as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable as inſupportable, and ſuch a degree of baſeneſſe and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, as dwells not in my Soul. And what diſhonours and diſadvantages attend not a King of baſe, low and ignoble qualities? If he addreſſe to his neighbour Princes, they will hardly looke on him as a Soveraign, or renowned perſon: If he preſume to deſire the aide of Auxiliaries and Souldiers, they will not onely have pretences, but deſpiſe &amp; ſcorn the Motion: if he continue in his Kingdome without Children, what ſupport can he expect if one of his Children be King?
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96822:68"/>
how can he reſolve and humble himſelf to give his Child obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? For ſuppoſe the Queen his Conſort ſhall (at her death) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine by Teſtament, That her Huſband whilſt hee liveth, ſhall conſerve, and exerciſe his Soveraigne power; with how many Nayles and Thornes will his Crown bee pierced; and how full of troubles his Reign; with what impatience will the Succeſſour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; and with what ſplendor and authority ſhall that Father rule, who ſwayes by the will of a dead Wife; and (at no leſſe) then at the pleaſure, or permiſſion of a living Son? And if caſually he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a ſecond Marriage, with how many fancies and jealouſies will his Son be agitated? and under this ſpetious pretence, to what ſtrange deſignes will he with his creatures be tranſported? (Generous <hi>Stanley)</hi> to receive a Crown from the hands of an eſpouſed Princeſſe, were to put on a reſolution to wait on her onely to her Tomb, and then to leave the Throne when ſhe leaves her life. And ſeeing that all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes (who are Soveraigns) have not the ſame reſolutions for their Husbands as <hi>Iſabella</hi> had for her <hi>Ferdinando:</hi> And it was not but with moſt incomparable virtue, that that moſt rare Princeſſe parted with her power, yet all that ſhe was able to doe, was but a participation; and notwithſtanding her affection was ſo great, and her virtues ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per excellent, yet where nothing could reſtrain her from a conteſtation with her Husband in her claims to her rights in the Kingdom of <hi>Leons,</hi> ſhe did it (doubtleſſe) with the greateſt Modeſty imaginable; yet with ſo great ſecurity to her ends, as the breath of Ambition could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. For it is apparent thus in all their expeditions, iſſuing forth in the names of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and their Subjects never ſpake of them but plurally, <hi>the Kings royall pleaſure.</hi> A word inſupportable, and not to be endured by ſo Princely a heart as I bear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judge you then (I pray) if <hi>Iſabella</hi> (whom Hiſtory deſcribes as a poſſeſſor of all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) could ſuppreſſe with the greateſt difficultyes, and ſtrip her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Soveraignty; how may it be expected then from a Princeſſe not ſo compleatly poliſhed? What know I (if I become her Spouſe) but ſhe may look upon me with ſcorn, as ſhe conſiders me a Subject to her Father and Brother? And who knows, but her elevated ſpirit may ſo uſe me as if I were her Subject? If I were now <hi>priſoner</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were glorious on her Throne, and ſhe had affections for me to redeem me out of <hi>Priſon,</hi> and Crown me with her Royall favours, and put into my hands the <hi>Scepter,</hi> it may bee the cloſeneſſe of my priſon might oblige me to deſire liberty, and my ſad condition encourage me to receive the Crown of <hi>England</hi> from her hands; but ſeeing ſhe hath no more ſhare in this Crown, but that I can with more right give it then accept it; and that it is the proper reward of mine own valour; I being now a Conquerour; and that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> without me could not have enjoyed her liberty, much leſſe have pretended to a Soveraignty: It is nobleneſſe in me rather to offer, then receive Royal Grace from the hands of Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and this is all that I can poſſibly doe, whereby the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (had it not right to the Crown of <hi>England)</hi> hath for ever indeared, and obliged the Houſe of <hi>York;</hi> and in this act the world muſt conclude me to have been as exactly, and ſcrupulouſly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Princeſſe for morality and civility, as to the maximes of Policie. Yet I inherit theſe generous rules which have gallant and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96822:69"/>
noble reſolutions, and which love rather to expoſe the hazard and loſs of all, then not to gain all, and rather march undauntedly, then not ſatisfie the ambition of my renown. <hi>Rights and pretences to Crowns ought to be reſolute principles never to be abandoned,</hi> all other pretenſions (in ſubordinate affairs) are admitted to their diſpenſations for change and alterations. But to Renown, Soveraignty, and the Right to a Crown, the reſolutions ought to be ſo unchangeable, as not to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and to yeeld, is an indignity and baſeneſſe fit for none of Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly birth; but is a quality more ſutable for the moſt infamous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible cowards. Now as to the third way; The title of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> you will tell me (perhaps noble <hi>Stanley)</hi> this ſeems dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and difficile, that the Peers and Nobles of the Kingdome have condemned the pretences and rights of the Family of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and that the Title of <hi>York</hi> hath a more popular preference in the ſpirits of the people; that the Kings of latter Reigns have gained their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that I may paſſe under the cenſure, not of a lawfull King, but an Uſurper; ſuch a ſuggeſtion may prove a provocation to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo faction beget a War, and that may continue as long as I lived. To this I anſwer, as before; the Rules of <hi>Policy</hi> I now follow, are generous, and hardy; wherefore I muſt not be ſwayed by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of perill; I muſt make my way through danger, and not ſuffer a diverſion in ſo weighty a matter to my reſolution. Think not, that I can eaſily perſwade, nor prevail to turn the courſe of that Royall bloud which runneth in my veins, or to renounce ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly thoſe rights to that Crown which I have conquered, as I muſt (doubtleſſe) if I ſhould referre my ſelfe to the grace and bounty of Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſhould receive ſo Illuſtrious a Diademe from the hand of a woman: what reproach ſhould I not receive from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, if I ſhould permit this ſpot to lye on the memory of my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? You will yet tell me, the right which I pretend hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, and condemned ſolemnly in Parliament. I anſwer; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation ſavoured of as much misfortune as injuſtice; <hi>Great thieves, and great power robbed us of our royall right:</hi> And ſuppoſe their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were juſt and equitable, the Rights of <hi>Conquerours</hi> are as equally Authentique; who <hi>if they have force, can juſtly cancell, and diſſolve to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all former edicts and ſentences of condemnation.</hi> Hee hath fought in vain who hath vanquiſhed a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and been a <hi>Liberator</hi> to the people from Tyranny, if he have not as equally freed himſelf from all oppreſſion, and can thereby maintaine his power to enjoy what he hath got. As for me, if I ſhould not aſcend a Throne but in the right of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I ſhould onely beleeve that I have changed my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and but gilded my chains: I can confeſſe no leſſe out of my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall repugnancy to this dependant authority. Beleeve me then in the Acceptance of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall receive it either as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, or as my right deſcending of the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and not from the hands of <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and if I admit her to the Throne, I ſhall place her on my right hand, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did <hi>Darius</hi>'s Queen; and yet not then, until I ſhall have the peaceable poſſeſſion of the Crown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interruption of any of her pretences. Yet, in this reſolution, I ſhall endeavour to ſpare the blood of my Subjects, for which I have reaſons; for <hi>my</hi> Forefathers have been their <hi>Kings;</hi> and if the laſt Prince of that Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had not been too mild and gentle,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96822:69"/>
and ſo more unfit to beare up the weight of ſo great a Scepter, I ſhould not now lye in neceſſity to ſearch for reaſons to palliate and authorize my preſent deſignes. But ſeeing what is paſt cannot be recalled, that which is preſent muſt regulate that which is to come. I ſhall aſcend then by the ſucceſſive way, wherein though there may be more of danger, there may be leſſe of injury. In this great action it is juſt that I forget not the peoples intereſt as well as mine owne, my Conqueſt ſhall ſerve me as to this end the more firmly to authorize the right of my Birth and deſcent. And as I am not ignorant how that the houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> hath prevailed with the whole Kingdome to an univerſall approbation of their title, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reignes of thoſe Princes to be more peacefull while they ruled, more then their wiſdome or policy could have prevailed: I intend no ſooner to receive the Crowne, but ſpeedily to incircle Princeſſe <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> with me within the Line of that Royall Circumference. But ſtill with this reſerve and difference, that ſhe ſhall receive that illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious honour from my hands, and not I from hers. Wherefore I ſhall take order that there ſhall be an interval &amp; ſpace of time, betwixt my Coronation &amp; my eſpouſals, that no perſon in my Kingdom may be ignorant with what right I aſcend my Throne. In the meane time the people that dive not ſo deeply into the ſecrecies &amp; myſteries of State, &amp; <hi>are more eaſily ſatisfied with ſpetious pretences then ſolid reaſon;</hi> will more readily honour and applaud our actions, and leſſe torment themſelves with murmurings or diſcontents; thoſe who have affections and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> will rejoyce exceedingly at my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Crowne; and thoſe who ſtill reſerve their affections for the houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> cannot be better ſatisfied then to ſee the Lawfull heire of that houſe to ſit on the Throne with me; and if it ſhould ſo chance that a civill Warre ſhould riſe, by any who ſhould ſuggeſt that the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was not dead, and that he had more right to the Crowne then the Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> I ſhall have this power to op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe ſuch falſs impoſtures, and this triple and different right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my Crowne; and if I owne it as Conqueror, as heire of the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and unite the title of that of <hi>Yorke,</hi> what power will be able to give a check to our Princely Reſolutions. All the waies which policy can invent to acquire and compaſſe great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, are either by open and hoſtile forces, or by ſecret and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till craft, or with plauſible pretences to delude the people, or with reaſon and Arguments to perſwade the Sages and Grandies of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, theſe are the ordinary engines of Policy. The firſt is moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and leaſt reſiſted, the ſecond is perſwaſive, and effects what ſeemes almoſt impoſſible, the third diſarmes the multitude, and the laſt raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diviſions and makes parties among great ones, and prepares a diſpoſition to hope for a victory of the Enemy: And fortune is ſo kinde to us to concenter all theſe foure advantages to my deſigne. Firſt as to force; I beleeve one cannot be more aſſured then having gained a Battle and defeated the enemy; and ſeeing the Tyrant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe could not longer ſupport his uſurpation, who (thinke you) dare be ſo bold as to deſigne to be an uſurper? To force I can joyn ſubtilty and craft, and what could there be better, then to intermingle ſo neerly, and yet to diſtinguish my right &amp; title before I did marry my right to that of <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> ſo to make my Authority as indiviſible as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96822:70"/>
independent by a deferring of my intentions for her eſpouſalls, untill my affaires perſwade me: And to this ſubtilty no pretences are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which may gain popular compliance and approbation; the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this now fully ſatisfied, that I act not meerly as Conqueror, nor take from any what appertaines to them; In this proceeding they will not onely be pleas'd, but ſeeme to enjoy their chiefeſt deſire. To theſe if ſtronger reaſons be required, what can better remove all ſcruple from the greateſt Stateſmen or Grandies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (too inclinable for factions, eſpecially in high Royall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) then to ſee the union of the two howſes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York?</hi> and thereby an extinction (by this alliance) of thoſe antient Quarrells which did deſcend with Ages, and might have laſted to a generall divaſtation of the Kingdome. Beſides all thoſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I find (moreover) all the vertues ſatisfied by this harmonious concluſion; <hi>Generoſity</hi> appeareth in my moderation, being ſo well tempered after ſo great a <hi>Victory:</hi> for ſeeing that after the Conqueſt of a Crown, I am ſo deliberate, it is an infallible marke that <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Preſumption</hi> have not elevated me above my ſelfe: my <hi>Bounty</hi> and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby I would preſerve the people and Kingdome from the poſſibility of a Civill Warre, render me more reaſonable, as being carefull of their good equally, as of my own. The <hi>Justice</hi> which I impartially intend to all, beginneth with Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> born ſo near the Throne, and renders my <hi>Heroick mind</hi> ſo famous, as meriting to be approved by all the World: The boldneſſe whereby I have vindicated the title of all my Anceſtors to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> will ſpeak me honourable in the eares of generous perſons, and that I ſhall be renowned by all thoſe who have a haughty inclination to true Magnanimity. In effect, <hi>A deſire to Reign and be a King, is a thing of it ſelf ſo high and noble, that</hi> I believe <hi>there was never yet any Heroick ſpirit who was not ſurprized and inflamed</hi> (above all ordinary degrees) <hi>with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſoveraignty;</hi> yea (I am fully perſwaded) that <hi>one borne from a Royal Throne, though his birth be diſtant and in a great remotion, yet it is impoſſible, but his dependencie (as a branch on that Royall ſtock) is reputed as the moſt ſoveraign glory and comfort of all his life,</hi> and I believe <hi>perſons of Princely deſcent, the more they are oppreſſed, the more the Royall Character is imprinted in their spirits: and the more they are forced to reſent of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by ſo much the more they deſire and thirst after domination and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty:</hi> And if the power of command be a naturall and univerſall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in all men, how ſupream muſt their deſires be, whoſe birth and education is ſo ſublime? their thoughts cannot but be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant (if poſſible to others) and their wills would be legiſlative. Think not then ſtrangly of me (brave <hi>Stanley)</hi> if intending my poſſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> I chiefly preferre mine owne right, without Admiſſion of a partage, or the leaſt ſhadow of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation for the title: Fortune honours me with it, as her preſent, yet I ſhall not accept it but as a fruite, growing on the ſtock of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and that my birth hath now received its right. Aſſiſt me then (I conjure thy fidelity) to fortifie my reaſons in a better reſiſtance (if there ſhall be cauſe) of oppoſition: tell thy friends and my ſubjects, that I aſcend the Throne, as their lawfull Soveraign, and that I ſhall have more affection and tenderneſſe for them, as being mine owne people, then as if they were <hi>Elizabeths;</hi> let the great ones know ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96822:70"/>
that I am their abſolute maſter, and therefore have greater power, as to receive, ſo to expect their ſervices: let my Souldiers know that I their King, am their <hi>Generall,</hi> and therefore, as I ſhall lead, they cannot but march with greater courage, and that their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is ſo much the more conſiderable, as not to be expoſed to a Battail, but for ſuch a Royall perſon, who will adventure with them, and bear them company in their Noble Actions. And let the Princeſſe know that if I take the Crown, which her Fathers have born, my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors have worn it as well as they; and in this quality her Grace may confeſſe that I merit more gloriouſly to be her husband, and to let her ſee, that without Scepter or Crown, ſhe is as dear and pretious to me. To conclude (gallant <hi>Stanley)</hi> proclaime to all the world (though I would claim the Crown as Conqueror) I have forborn it, though I might have accepted a Crown from the hands of a Princeſſe, I refuſed it, and that I have rather choſen to hazard the Throne which I have Conquered, then not to poſſeſs it as a legitimate Prince, and the iſſue and Heir of the Royall houſe of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>

                     </gap>cious dependant ſubordination: which quality though it may agree with the Genius of a Subject, yet cannot be compatible &amp; tolerable in the digeſtion of a victorious Conqueror. Where a Queen hath the ſoveraign right, and the King a title onely by marriage, it is not he, but ſhe that ruleth. Now if a Crown be not establiſh't, it hath not it's perfect beauty: if a Scepter be divided, it is no longer a Scepter: if two ſit on a Throne, it looſeth its form, and is no longer a Throne. The Electors of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Polony,</hi> entrench too deeply on the authority of their Maſters: if a Prince ſee any interpoſition betwixt him and God, he cannot ſtile himſelf Abſolute: and if he have not Right to ſay, it is our will and pleaſure, and declare (without farther Reaſon) and ſay, <hi>ſtat pro ratione voluntas;</hi> he carries but the ſhadow of a Soveraignty, he may wear the Crown, but others exerciſe the Royall Office. Now if this kind of Government be not ſo noble, then to hold a Crown by the Right or favour of a wife is neither ſo ſafe nor ſo honourable. The <hi>Electors</hi> are ſtiled ſubjects, and all Commiſſions and Edicts are ſigned in the Princes name, but it is not ſo where the wife is ſupream. The Sun which divideth the radiant beames to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe in his courſe, comprehendeth all ſplendent lustre in his own glorious body, and when that is ſet, no brightneſſe at all appears, but what is (in its abſence) communicated to ſome leſſer Starrs to preſerve the World from utter darkneſſe and obſcurity. Thus, this wiſe Prince did judge of Soveraignty, which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96822:71"/>
though it communicate glorious raies, yet they are Originally united in one il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious body, and thoſe leſſer lights, which as the Moon and Starrs radiate with more Glimmering and Dusky Brightneſſe, they have no native, but mutuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and borrowed light. A quality utterly inconſiſtent with a generous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Soul, and which agrees not with the Nature of Soveraignty. If this Prince had held his Crown by the title of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he muſt have depended on the will and pleaſure of his Wife; and never been able to ſway and command ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely. <hi>It is our will and pleaſure.</hi> As the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy, ſo it had now a King who ſcorn'd to loſe the leaſt circumstance or Punctilio that might grace the splendor and brightneſſe of Majeſty. And as for the Complication and Acts of Grace to gratifie his people, he rather admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and uſed ſuch pleaſant Popular baits, out of Policy and deeper deſigne to prevent all ſtormes, or to calme them if they ſhould riſe, then to diminiſh or extenuate the Grandure of Majeſty. Thoſe condeſcentions (Kings know well) are great Artifices of their own making, which when the fiſh is caught they underſtand, &amp; know how to unrovel &amp; break the nets to their own advantage. The Scripture teacheth that <hi>the woman is to be ſubject to the man, and not the man to the woman.</hi> Had not this divine rule given liberty and dispenſation to this Princes action and choice, Policy (a more liberall, and free dispencer of her counſels) would not ſtick at the diſcouragement of ſuch Reſolutions which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to grasp at ſupreame Authority. The example of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> demonſtrate that Maſculine Nobleneſſe ſubjected to Feminine fancies, and their mutable pleaſures is neither ſo ſatisfactory, ſo honourable, nor ſo ſafe. And that other example of <hi>Philip the ſecond,</hi> who married <hi>Mary Queen of England,</hi> manifeſteth, that ſuch a conjunction with an expectation of <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> as concomitant, proveth but a more fine Golden chaine to bind faster (at pleaſure) Royall ambition; for ſo was that Prince deluded and abuſed in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, who inſtead of <hi>Soveraign</hi> commands had onely the honour of a Title, joyned in <hi>Commiſſions</hi> and <hi>Coyns,</hi> but had not the power to exerciſe the Royal office. It is apparent then, a <hi>Scepter</hi> is onely fit for one, and not two hands, and that a Crown (being circular inform) is only proper for one Soveraign head. The two famous Queens of <hi>Naples</hi> have taught all the world the dangers of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hold Crowns by Female rights: And this Prince was a perſon too ſage and prudent to expoſe his Royall advantages to ſuch caſuall alterations, having made ſo noble a Conqueſt, he holdeth ſtill faſt his ſword in his hand, and espouſeth <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> with all her rights and poſſibilities, and wiſely chooſeth and declareth none but his own title, keeping thoſe others as great Souldiers doe their Reſerves at distance, rather to terrifie, then to fight, unleſſe there be great occaſion. In this action this King, whatever he pretended of Grace to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo to be a great Moraliſt, herein hath left to the world this teſtimony; That he was acquainted with the deepeſt and moſt profound wayes of Policy; and therefore did more prudently make his election, and ſo pitch his reſolution, rather to reigne by his own, then the pretence or right of any other. Now if from an action of ſuch famous valour and prudence, we alter our diſcourſe to another as eminent for fidelity; here is an example in the perſon of an <hi>Infidell Prince,</hi> which is most remarkable. <hi>Soliman</hi> the ſecond (that Prince who was the glory of the <hi>Ottoman Family)</hi> promiſed to <hi>John,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to eſtabliſh his Empire, to which purpoſe <hi>Soliman</hi> was earneſt, conſtant, and faithfull to his reſolution: But the Warre being ſomewhat unfortunate, or leſſe ſuccesfull, and having loſt the lives of an <hi>hundred thouſand men,</hi> the <hi>Baſſawes,</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> would have interrupted, and prevented the ſaid Kings inveſtment, and Inauguration unto the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> though <hi>Soliman</hi> had made his

royall promiſe: But ſee here <hi>Solimans</hi> diſcourſe and reaſons which cauſed that generous <hi>Monarch</hi> to keep his faith and reſolution, and to crown gloriouſly <hi>John</hi> in the famous Town of <hi>Bude.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Counſell which you give me might have been approved by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond, but not by <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> that Prince who kept not his word with the Emperour <hi>David Comineus,</hi> and his Children, who cauſed the death of Prince <hi>Boſnie,</hi> and <hi>Methelin,</hi> contrary to his promiſes; purſued thoſe Maximes which agree not with <hi>Soliman.</hi> 'Tis true, he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great Conquerour, and the <hi>twelve Kingdomes</hi> which he ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereby united the two Empires, merit much to his honour, and free his actions from being cenſured with too much rigour and ſeverity; and by what means he reigned ſo puiſſantly. And as to my own particular (becauſe I enjoyed his Conqueſts) it may leſs become me to inſult over his errors, or to rail at his proceedings againſt the rules of exact Juſtice; yet ſeeing truth and fidelity to my word and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted honour are the marks I chiefly aim at, I ſhall not judge it irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional nor injuſt to ſay that <hi>Mahomets</hi> forfeiting of his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe hath ſtained the beauty of his Reputation, &amp; if he had been more ſacred in obſervation of his word and promiſe with his enemies, he had not gained leſs true glory then his conqueſts have rendred to his name. I am not ignorant that <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath not been the ſole example of my Predeceſſors, who have falſified their Faith without the leaſt ſcruple, and that many Polititians yeeld and perſwade, that it is lawful to deceive thoſe whom they can delude, and that fraud and fowrbs are commendable and innocent inſtruments; and as for ſincerity, it is not laudable, much leſs neceſſary, but when advantageous and convenient. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (as well as the <hi>Turks)</hi> (who ſeem to be obliged by the bonds of <hi>Religion,</hi> and upon pains of hell) permit theſe rules and maxims amongſt them very ordinarily, and have not kept their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith inviolable, to compaſs and effect their particular aims and deſigns; and yet ſome of the <hi>Ottoman Princes</hi> have been moſt exact and ſtrict in keeping of their word. Thus the magnificent <hi>Selim</hi> (of famous memory) though naturally haughty and ambitious, was moſt punctual in his Conditions and Articles with the Citizens of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring their Town, he ſaved their lives, and preſerved their goods from pillage and plunder; nay he was ſo exact to every circumſtance, that although his numerous forces had incamped, and lay round about that vaſt Town, wherein the prey and wealth was infinite, and might have largely inriched the whole army, yet <hi>Selim</hi> permitted not any one ſouldier to commit the leaſt inſolence, nor ſo much as to gather a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of fruit or herbs out of the ſtately and luxuriant Gardens which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96822:73"/>
lay round about the walls. And doeſt thou know <hi>(Ruſtan)</hi> what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſucceeded this exact curioſity of his fidelity and Paroll? The inhabitants of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> gave more by a peaceable ſurrender, and the Emperour received more then he and his Army could have gotten, if they had pillaged the Town; for by this example of the Emperours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act law of his word, the towns of <hi>Barute,</hi> of <hi>Sidon,</hi> of <hi>Tripoly,</hi> of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,</hi> and (ſpeedily after) thoſe of <hi>Syria</hi> ſubmitted, and ſurrendred on the faith and credit of the Emperours word; by this meanes a great hardſhip of War, and an expenſive, and vaſt charge was ſaved, and the lives of many thouſands preſerved from death. But you may tell me <hi>(Ruſtan)</hi> the chiefe meanes to inlarge Territoryes, or to confirme, or aſſure Conqueſts, to deſtroy Enemies, to invade Townes, to ſubdue Provinces, and Kingdomes, is it not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning fraud and deceit with force and Armes? and by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, but not intending to keep it? are not Townes ſurrendred, the Gates of Caſtles and Forts opened to ſpetious and ſmooth delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? Whereby great and potent Adverſaries have committed themſelves (in perſon) to their Enemies? what need we ſearch far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then into the Hiſtories of the firſt founders of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well as into the life of the valiant <hi>Orchan,</hi> who ſucceeded them; we ſhall find that if they had not as well uſed artificiall deluſions, fraud and falſhood; they had not ſo frequently ſurprized Townes, ſubdued Provinces, nor Conquered Kingdoms, nor laid ſuch ſtrong foundations to that <hi>Empire,</hi> which I now poſſeſſe, and which appears in its preſent condition to foretell her happy fruition of her victories to as great glory and duration as the <hi>Romans</hi> extended theirs. Do you not then think that too ſtrict and punctual obſervation to your faith, &amp; word, may be an obſtacle to your agrandizing and future eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Empire? To all theſe I anſwer, I am of the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as believing that an honourable Regard of ones word, and a conſervation of his faith ſolemnly and publiquely given, is the beſt way and meanes to begin, to inlarge, or to eſtabliſh a Soveraignty. When I call to mind then, and examine my faith and promiſe made to King <hi>John,</hi> and my Ingagement to uſe my beſt indeavours to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh him in his Throne, Judge you if I be not obliged to keep my word inviolable: For which all Mortalls are ſtrictly bound if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to forget humanity and honour, and true renown. And if ſo ſevere a tye be morally imprinted on the Soules of all men, how particularly are <hi>Princes,</hi> who are in degrees of honour, as far tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their ſubjects, as the leſſer Starrs are inferiour to the luſtre of the Sun. For in the obſervation of their Royall Parole, the Peoples happineſſe, and the Soveraignes glory chiefly conſiſteth. To confirme this argument, and ſo to know more exactly the ſacredneſſe of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; you may conſider that the Religions of all kind which ever were or ſhall be, have never reſtrained, nor ever ſhall oblige the people, but by this way. Heaven it ſelfe is witneſſe by the conſtancy of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to what I ſay. In effect, what diſorder and confuſion would ſucceed to any eſtate, if men ſhall declare to make open profeſſion, that they did not regard what they did ſay, or promiſe? what would be the diſorder, and how irregular the ſociety in every particular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? what inconveniency and a generall diſturbance to all commerce? and what union and agreement can be expected or hoped for amongſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96822:73"/>
the people, which is the very foundation, and frameth a Solidity to the ſtation, and continuance of Empires? It is through faith in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that amity and friendſhip are preſerved, that all Artizans and labourers work with ſo much curioſity and paines: this cauſeth the Marriners to imbarque, and ſo boldly to adventure their lives at Sea, incourageth the <hi>Souldiers</hi> to be ſo hardy and valiant in the Warrs: And without this, it would be impoſſible to govern either in peace or War. So then the keeping of faith inviolate, conduceth much to the rule and government of all the univerſe, and is as neceſſary to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, as a foundation is to a ſtately and magnificent ſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. Without this incomparable bond, all ſociety would be diſſolved into confuſion, lawes be deſpiſed and ſcorned, Fathers would not have any Reverence from their Children, nor Children any kindneſs from their Parents, friends would grow perfidious, Commanders would trample on their Souldiers, and they as inſolently injure or forſake their Commanders, Subjects would have no aſſurance in their Princes, nor Princes any reſpect or honour from their Subjects. You ſee then <hi>(Ruſtan)</hi> that a conſtant obſervation to ones faith and parole, is not only honourable but neceſſary; and without which it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but to go into moſt irreparable misfortunes. Moreover this quality is the more noble, becauſe no creature is capable to effectuate in this kind but onely rational, and the incomparable creature man; as for other qualities they may be Acquired by Habits, or poſſeſſed by Temperaments and natural Inſtincts, as appears in the very Bruits. We find fidelity in <hi>Dogs,</hi> love in the <hi>Turtles,</hi> violent inclinations of tendernes in the <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> creatures towards their young ones; the Lions have their generoſity and boldneſs, the Serpents their prudence, the Elephant their wit and memory, and the little Ants their providence in their Oeconomie; but as for the obſervation of faith and promiſes, thoſe are actions onely belonging to Man, by which he becometh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of anothers will, as well as of his own, ſo that in theſe occaſions it may bee well ſaid, that there is a neceſſity as indiſpenceable to keep ones word, as to obey a Law before a promiſe made; this caution is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be uſed, <hi>that no man exceed the reall and abſolute limits of his own power, not to ingage his faith in any thing evill in it ſelf, or injurious to another.</hi> Theſe limitations firſt propoſed, faith is obligatory, and binding, and no retractation to be admitted, which in it ſelf cannot be leſs then baſe and diſhonourable. Theſe conſiderations concerne perſons of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and as for Kings, <hi>they are not free from the obligation of their Parole more then the meaneſt of their Subjects:</hi> For if they make a promiſe to their equals, and fail in it, their equals may force and compel them to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and if to their Inferiours, juſtice and honour obliges them to be exact to their own will and pleaſure, which once ingaged is not longer free, but hath a tye and obligation on it, which they have impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and framed to themſelves. There cannot be then (with juſtice and honor) a failing in Faith, nor any fair evaſion; the very poſſibility which Princes have in their own power not to oblige themſelves to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, foretels their facility to obſervation, which they cannot (but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own reaſon) diſanul and diſpence withall. Nay if a Prince ſhall condeſcend to a reſolution and ſolemn promiſe, to depoſe his Crown, I cannot but judge it more glorious for him to keep his word, then to hold his Scepter. Fundamentall Laws (though in themſelves
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96822:74"/>
ſacred and inviolable) yet ought not to be in ſo great a veneration with a Prince as obſervation to his own word: For it may ſo arrive in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of Ages, that Policy may permit and perſwade to change, and alter thoſe firſt ordinances, which have founded and ſupported a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi> but as for the word of a <hi>King,</hi> it ought to be inchangeable; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, levity, and falshood will ſo ſpot his reputation, that he will hardly ever obliterate the ſtain of Infamy; and what fidelity, or loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty can be expected from Subjects to be paid to him, who is not noble and faithfull to himſelf? If you object <hi>(Ruſtan)</hi> that the King is leſſe obliged becauſe he is ſo tranſcendent above them. I anſwer; a Prince is free before he pleaſeth to promiſe; but if he ſhall fail afterwards to gratifie his humour, or ambition, or to give way to his own paſſions, he will provoke not only his peoples hatred, but (if poſſible) their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; whom though they do not command, do expect that he ſhould obey the dictates of his own will; and if this intercourſe ſhould faile, how ſhould the Prince confide in his people, or they in him? If I ſhould deſign a noble recompence to my <hi>Baſhaws</hi> and <hi>Janizaries,</hi> in caſe they ſhould effect ſome noble and grand enterpriſe, might I not give a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous check to my commands and power, if I ſhould ſtart from my word, and ſo they fail in their reward? If I were engaged with mine Army before a Town, and reſolved to ſubdue it, and encouraged my Souldiers to ſtorm and take it, and gave them promiſe of the prey, and pillage, and then did not prove noble and faithfull, and did not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them, having adventured their lives in the aſſault, and breach with ſuch violence and mettle to get the Victory; might not ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity not onely loſe mine honour, but provoke a mutiny, and hazard the loſſe of mine own Army? Again, if the Inhabitants of a Town ſhould agree voluntarily to ſubmit, without other conditions, but the ſaving of their lives, and after I had received the Keyes of their Ports, &amp; the Gates were open, then I ſhould ſuffer them to fall by the Edge of the ſword; would not ſuch an Act obſcure the honour of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince? and force the remainder and ſurvivant party to fight &amp; diſpute to the laſt drop of their bloods? and might not ſuch unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe cauſe mine owne Souldiers to turn Cowards, or to make them turn their ſwords againſt their own Prince? would not ſuch Actions as theſe increaſe the valour of the Enemy, cauſe them to redouble their Guards, and inſpire them with new deſignes, to deceive with falſhood him whom they could neither ſubdue nor believe? were not ſuch a Prince indangered to be cenſured as the firebrand of his Age, and as well born to be the Enemie of his neighbours, and the odium of his own ſubjects, as well as of his Enemies? and as for Princes, if they as well conſider their intereſt as their honour, they are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged for their advantage, to whom they have promiſed, but likewiſe for their own ends: And it is a great diſpute, whether it be of greater importance to keep faith with friends or enemies; and the moſt ſubtle Polititians do conclude, that in a caſe of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>a breach with friends is more tolerable then with enemies,</hi> whoſe eyes are moſt acute and exact, to obſerve every ſcruple of conditions or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles covenanted to them: For when our Allyes, our friends, and our ſubjects do affie in us, they do no more then their duties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voires; of which if they failed their neglect were injury, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their truſt in us augmenteth our glory, and equitably obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96822:74"/>
us to keep our faith with them: but when it arriveth that our profeſſed Enemies place their aſſurance in our parole, this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible mark of that eſtimation which they have of our vertue not of our power: And this conception worketh for our glory, and teſtifieth ſo much for our generoſity, that (I dare boldly ſay) <hi>if it be injuſtice and baſeneſſe to forfeit one's parole to his friend: It is an act of more horrid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe mixt with perfideouſneſſe and impudency, not to keep faith with an Enemy.</hi> I cannot then with my honour let this opportunity eſcape, which fortune now preſenteth, but I muſt obſerve that which I have promiſed to this diſtreſſed Prince; to him (I ſay) who hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, what ruine and ravages our armies have committed in his Kingdom. He it is who confideth in us, and hath choſen him who was the greateſt Enemy to this Kingdome to be the <hi>Protector</hi> of his <hi>Crown.</hi> We cannot delude his hopes <hi>(Ruſtan)</hi> nor with any honour recede from our promiſe. I know well that ſome rules of Policy oppoſe my deſign. If I ſhould make uſe of them, and if I ſhould permit an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, many conſiderations will ariſe, and you may tell me (firſt) that <hi>John</hi> engaged me to this Warre, and that the fates, which go verns all things, have produced ſad and black effects to both parties, ſince I have taken the <hi>Fortes</hi> of <hi>Bude</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Altemberg,</hi> that other of <hi>Komar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> of <hi>Wiſſegrade,</hi> and all other along the <hi>Danube:</hi> My Army have pillaged all <hi>Syria,</hi> and made an infinite number of ſlaves, and have ſo terrified the Emperor <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> that he durſt not preſume, with his Army once to face my force; &amp; after all theſe ſucceſſes I am at laſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in the Towne of <hi>Bude,</hi> ready to inveſt and re-enthrone <hi>John King of Hungary;</hi> and if that ſiege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the extremity of the winter have cauſed me to loſe an hundred thouſand men, I might ſeem to complain rather of this Prince then to render to him his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and honour him with his Crown. This may agree beſt with your ſence: but it is true, I cannot ſubmit to your Judgement. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of one, I had loſt two hundred thouſand men, I ſhould not have deſiſted from my intentions, out of meer conſideration to my faith and promiſe. I never ſuffered my profit and advantage to be competitors, or comparative with my glory and renown. And when I ſhall faile to be a ſtrict obſerver of my faith, I cannot judge my ſelf worthy of reſpect or honour. Of all the waies of Conqueſt theſe are moſt ſure, which are effected with leaſt violence. In making a <hi>King</hi> my <hi>Tributary</hi> and Vaſſall, I create a more illuſtrious ſlave to be as faithful and obedient, as if impriſoned with fettered Chaines: The <hi>recognition of diſtreſſes relieved, oblige a Prince more powerfully then the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervitude:</hi> And <hi>thoſe Tributes which are paid to a King by a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, do more inrich his treaſure, then thoſe which are exacted.</hi> For you cannot be ignorant how that in a Country newly Conquered, Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be eſtabliſhed in the principall Forts and Townes; beſides, it is to be provided that an Army be ready to march, on all occaſions, to be ready to oppoſe all reſiſtance that may ariſe, and yet this care and providence is to be exerciſed, to ſee that the people be not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed as well as ſubdued from the power of Revolts: Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy teaching that they have not too much liberty, leaſt they grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, nor too ſevere a ſervitude, leaſt they grow deſperate; <hi>a mixture of gentleneſſe with rigour is neceſſary in lawfull Royalty, but more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inſeparable from the foundation of new Conqueſts.</hi> Moreover, in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96822:75"/>
eſtabliſhment of a Tributarie Prince, more ſweetneſſe and indulgence is tolerable, becauſe he is ſubſtituted to all care, charge and paines, and ſuch a Conqueſt is as well without inquietude as danger. If I had intended otherwiſe, I muſt have fought many battailes, beſieged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns, and (beſides a hazard not to have obtained what I now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy) I might have loſt honour and reputation. Moreover my viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith with this Prince, might have united and provoked other Princes to levy forces, and march unanimouſly againſt me: And what Grace or honour might that Emperor expect, but rather a generall deteſtation from all, who deſerved to be branded with ignominy and reproach, for being perfidious and falſe? will not both Princes and Subjects act to ſave their lives, to defend their Country, preſerve their liberties, and revenge their Prince from a faithleſſe and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon? But you will tell me <hi>(Ruſtan)</hi> after ſo many battailes, and ſo many ſignall Advantages, what need I fear, and what might I not hope for? No, no, <hi>Fortune is too mutable a Lady to be confided in: We are not to abuſe her favours, nor ſcorne her liberality, nor to depend on the Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her graces, who is ſo changable at her pleaſure.</hi> She who hath given us all theſe Victories, hath power to deprive us of them, and as oft as I think, what great obſtacles ſtood in the way, to oppoſe the mighty ſucceſſe of valiant <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and many of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; I cannot prudently be over confident in my own Armies, my Enemies weakneſſe, nor my own valour. For <hi>it is poſſible, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conquerors may be vanquiſhed,</hi> and conſequently, nothing is to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded highly. The fortunes which attended <hi>Amurath</hi> and <hi>Bajazet,</hi> may alſo waite on me, and another <hi>Caſtriot</hi> or <hi>Tamerlaines</hi> may ariſe to prevail over me. Let us not then abuſe our Enemies in the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of faith, nor thereby occaſion all the world to oppoſe and hate us, which they may do without injuſtice, and then the fates produce ſtrange and wonderfull effects. <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſtopped the Progreſſe of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he was highly ingaged; <hi>Camillus</hi> preſerved his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when it was feared he would have deſtroyed it. Beſides all theſe reaſons, the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> affords us examples of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Kings to be Tributaries, Slaves, and Vaſſalls. And if true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown be ſo exceedingly glorious in the ſubjection of the Common People; how ſuperexcellent, and moſt illuſtrious is a command over Kings and Princes? Thus <hi>Antonius</hi> marcht with <hi>two and twenty Princes,</hi> (as his Royall attendance) into <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This infallible enſigne of honour declares to all the world, that the <hi>Romans</hi> made not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies their Enemies their Slaves, but gave them liberty to <hi>weare</hi> their <hi>Crownes,</hi> to make their Royall Equipage more glorious. <hi>It is one of the greateſt ſecrets of Policy, ſo to temper and manage affaires, as to make our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſerviceable to us.</hi> And no advantage can be higher, then to make them fight for us, who fought againſt us. And as for this Kingdome of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which is now divided by the Factions of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> it would be (doubtleſſe) united againſt me, if I ſhould be perfidious to that party, which I am ingaged to: And ſo that whole Country become mine enemies, which (on theſe terms) are reduced to be my vaſſals: By this action I ſhall either augment my Soveraignty; or, if the diviſion continues, more infeeble the adverſe party. <hi>Princes ought deeply to conſider before they engage their faith; but if they value their honour, they are obliged to perform their promiſe, though it ſucceed</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:96822:75"/>
                  <hi>with the greatest loſs.</hi> This obligation bindeth more eſſentially; becauſe it is a vow not made to Subjects, but to a Prince by one in diſtreſſe; he who renders himſelf my Vaſſal, and hath truſted to my word for the ſafety of his perſon. And ſhould my falſhood make my advantage in a Princes neceſſity, who relies on my fidelity, and flies to me for ſuccour? When the Emperour <hi>Ferdinando</hi> (who is an enemy formidable enough) deſired my Alliance, I publickly both refuſed and ſcorned his Amity: And it had not become me now to have admitted this Prince to the ſecreſie of my promiſe and reſolutions, if I had not firſt exactly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how far I might condeſcend and adventure for his protection. No, no <hi>(Ruſtan)</hi> I ſhould rather chooſe to loſe my life, then to forefeite my Parole, which I ſhall preſerve ſo inviolable, that I ſhall Crown King <hi>John</hi> with mine own hands, that all poſterity may learn from me that it is a neceſſary obligation (equally concerning the peoples good, as well as the Princes glory) to keep and guard their promiſes, without any fraud or violation. It is by this indiviſible chain that the univerſall ſociety of Mankind ſubſiſteth in that union which inableth ſo many divers Nations to treat and commerce ſo unanimouſly in their affairs. This is that ſacred bond which cauſeth voluntarily the arms of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands (though enemies) peacefully to be laid down. This is that ſolemn aſſurance which perſwadeth and ſecureth peace after bloody Wars. If men ſhould not have a regard and obſervation to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll, <hi>Iuſtice, which is the foundation of all virtues, would find no place for her feet to ſtand in all the world;</hi> and if ſhee failed, all other virtues would loſe their grace and beauty; Juſtice it ſelf would loſe her denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be ſtiled rigour, or ſeverity; Clemencie would be reputed too much indulgent levity. Liberality would be cenſured prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and Valour (if not ſuccesfull) would be accounted raſhneſſe, or too much confidence. And it is true, though <hi>virtues conſiſt in moderation, yet when the action is not ſeaſonable, they ſeem to wear the habits of vice.</hi> But as for fidelity to ones Paroll, it admits of no various explications, but ought to be exactly obſerved, at all times, in all places, and with all perſons; and as to mine own reſolutions (being a Soveraign Prince) I ſhall not be falſe, but faithfull to all, whether Kings or Shepheards; nor faile in that (which ſeems moſt difficult) to keep my Parole with mine Enemy. This Law is properly mine own, becauſe voluntary; therefore to be obeyed without all repugnancie. It is in this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein my reaſon is ſo mightily convinced, that I reverence the ſanctity of publick Faith; to violate which becomes not men, much leſſe Kings. And as for my ſelfe, to bee falſe to my Faith I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable.</p>

Let this dangerous <hi>Florentine</hi> poiſon the World as far as he can with his infectious Principles; yet I dare to ſay, his Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes are as empty and void of reaſon as Religion.

For Princes are at liberty, before they promiſe, but once engaged, ought to be ſubſervient to their dictates, and deſires of their own wills: And <hi>who ever faileth to keep his faith, looſeth his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and common honeſty.</hi> And <hi>a being not obliged by the rules of Religion, giveth a Check to all Rights, both humane and divine.</hi> But I ſee a great Champion, and an illuſtrious Commander contradicting this propoſition, and urgeth that no rule is ſo generall, but admitteth of ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Embaſſador of <hi>Amurath</hi> (having reproached me in the behalf of the <hi>Emperor</hi> his Maſter) hath dared to charge my reputation, with the ugly crimes of <hi>Perfidiouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Treaſons:</hi> which ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls and accuſations my Soule ſcornes and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrs; If all men in the World ſhould not be as equally guilty of thoſe errois, as my ſelf; And ſeeing <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> loved not glory it ſelfe, but with ſcrupulous Curioſity, and he bravely affirmed, that <hi>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly abhorred, to ſteal a Victory,</hi> by ſurpriſing it in obſcurity or the night: I preſume I may be admitted to conclude, that I hate the thoughts, to have ſtolne that glory away, which I poſſeſſe, had I not acquired it by noble and illuſtrious meanes. Be you then my Judges in this point, (although my Officers and Subjects) examine my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the greateſt rigour, that the ſeverity of Juſtice, or the brightneſſe of true generoſity can exact or require, and be not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (for ſo I conjure you) whether or no, thoſe may forfeit the glory of their valour and faith juſtly, who have been provoked by actions of infidelity from others? and whether this reciprocal retaliation, may not be honourably ſupported and grounded on the Baſis and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of reaſon. I know well, that <hi>publick Faith ought to be placed and ranked with the moſt choice, and ſacred things;</hi> but not to be ſincere nor to keep Faith with him, who hath firſt violated that ſacred bond, is not onely lawfull but commendable, and an Action which ſeemes guided with reaſon, and juſtice. This is the chiefeſt argument of my diſcourſe, which cannot but honourably patronize, what I ſhall maintaine and defend. <hi>The Lawes of Nations</hi> (which doubtleſſe) approach neareſt to Nature and Reaſon, <hi>have not ordaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ce.</hi> And is it not as equally juſt to puniſh and revenge thoſe (who pretending to protect innocency) have actually deſigned to ruine and deſtroy? Is not a defence and preſervation lawfull, when Faith is firſt violated, and nothing but miſchiefe intended? Is power therfore juſt, becauſe 'tis great? or may men do miſchiefe equitably, becauſe they are able? and may not a ſelf defence, or the deſtruction of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96822:78"/>
Enemy be as equally tolerated? And (if we ſhould now paſſe from particular quarrells to open and publik Warrs) is it not moſt true, and that either in hoſtile invaſions, or inteſtine broiles, that one party is more criminous and unjuſt then the other; and ſo the firſt invader or diſturber of peace? To make more particular inſtance, ſeeing that <hi>Amurath</hi> hath invaded the Kingdom of his <hi>Allie,</hi> ſurprized his Townes, ſuborned his Subjects, pillaged his Country, and hath received the Prince and his Children <hi>Hoſtages,</hi> and afterwards bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and violated his Faith; are not theſe Provocations too horrid and inſufferable; and can they juſtly expect any recompence, but of wrath and revenge, if a power offended, be rendred capable to make ſuch a requitall? On theſe conſiderations, the world cannot but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge me, from the guilt of being either perfidious or traiterous. <hi>He who firſt violateth his Faith, and is an invader of the Princely Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Neighbour, authorizeth his Enemy to all endeavours, to make his higheſt revenges on him.</hi> And he who before was criminous, and therefore puniſhed, becommeth innocent and juſt; And that which the Enemy calleth treaſon, is a ſage conduct of affaires; that which hee termeth Cruelty, becomes a naturall and juſt defence. So then, that which is permitted by the Laws of Nations to private perſons, and which injuries and bitter extremities have neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated, cannot but be allowed to my juſt and rationall defence. To this purpoſe, I cannot but look on <hi>Amurath</hi> as my particular enemy, cauſing the death of my <hi>Brothers</hi> whom he barbarouſly <hi>poiſoned,</hi> and ſo as the publick and common enemy of my eſtate, which he had moſt unjuſtly uſurped. And if (in my own perſon) I have moſt miraculouſly eſcaped, doubtleſs my comportment, guarded me more ſecurely: For I reſpected him ceremoniouſly as a great <hi>Prince,</hi> preventing his ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with my prudence; and if I have learned to forfeit my <hi>Parole,</hi> I received that direction from the infidelity and falſhood of <hi>Amurath;</hi> by which means I have found a way open to revenge the death of my <hi>Brothers</hi> by ſlaying his <hi>Baſſaws;</hi> and have requited the ruins of my Country, with the defeats of his armies. Yet if you will make a clearer inſpection, and dive more deep to ſearch the reaſons of my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I muſt put you in mind how antient <hi>Macedonia</hi> (that famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) was aſſaulted by this puiſſant enemy; that <hi>Albania</hi> (formerly but a Province) endured many of his violences, as other neighbouring and vicine Territories. At length King <hi>Iohn</hi> my Father (tired with the continuance of the War, and touched compaſſionately for the miſeries of his people) reſolved to render himſelf tributary to his Empire, and to this purpoſe he committed his children hoſtages, hoping, that when my Father died; this cruell <hi>Monster</hi> would have ſent one of his Sons to have been his Succeſſor to have reigned over his Subjects: But (O juſt heavens) at that very time when I was fighting for him, &amp; expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my life for his ſervice in the atchievements of his glory &amp; renown, the King my Father dying, he diſpatched <hi>Sebalick</hi> (his creature) with troops of Horſe &amp; Foot to ſeize on the noble City of <hi>Croy,</hi> &amp; all the reſt of the chief Towns of <hi>Albania;</hi> at which time he exiled the Queen my Mother to a poor pittance &amp; corner of the world, without reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her perſon, who as ſhe was a Queen, ſo ſhe was the Daughter of the King of <hi>Triballieus;</hi> &amp; if he ſpared my perſon (in this juncture of affairs) it was not through any affection or reſentment to humanity, or Juſtice,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96822:78"/>
but only for that reaſon, becauſe he conceived he might make great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by my conduct and employment in his Wars and ſervice: Which if I had pleaſed to quit, he might (happily) have loſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of his Army. And hitherto, what hath <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> done againſt <hi>Amurath?</hi> Or rather what offices of love doth not <hi>Amurath</hi> owe to <hi>Scanderbeg?</hi> hath his fidelity in any proportion been equal to mine? How could I not (if I had thought fit) have refuſed his firſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and continued my repoſe within his Court? <hi>Hoſtages</hi> are more noble then to be treated as Slaves: And if I had not been encouraged by the generoſity of mine own ſpirit, I would not have expoſed my life or honour for his ſervice: And ſeeing that (at that time) he pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually kept conditions, agreed on by the King my Father, I had cauſe to hope that he would continue a ſucceſſion to his fidelity. Grounded on this confidence, I reſolved to gratifie his Commands with my choiceſt endeavours, expecting that when that Prince ſhould die, to whom I was ſucceſſor, I might his aſcend throne, and ſo by double ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, he might be more firmly bound to keep his Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role. It was this apprehenſion that invited me to take the charge of <hi>Sangiac,</hi> and without being ſo much as a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> I forbore not to appear a rigid <hi>Turk.</hi> In the firſt troubles of <hi>Aſia,</hi> I commanded a party of <hi>five hundred men,</hi> with ſo good ſucceſſe, that the very reputation of that ſervice rendered me capable to bee made <hi>Generall</hi> of his ſecond Army, wherewith I effected marvellous advantages to the <hi>Empire.</hi> You cannot but remember how <hi>Amurath</hi> received, or rather ſlighted me at <hi>Andrinople,</hi> then, after ſo famous a Victory I reconducted his Army, without the loſs of more then <hi>two hundred men,</hi> when the ſpoils of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies appeared ſo great, that they amazed <hi>Amurath,</hi> as well as other ſpectators, to behold ſo great riches, ſo many ſlaves, ſuch a number of Flags, Enſigns, and bruiſed and battered Arms recovered from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; then the multitudes could not be reſtrained from calling me the <hi>Reſtaura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beſides this (it may be) you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in what faſhion I preſerved the honour of that Nation, when that audacious and fierce <hi>Scythian</hi> preſented a defiance to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to that end that one of his Court Champions might have accepted the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and when no other perſon was found inclinable and reſolute, I undertook the Combat; and if I had not vanquiſhed the inſolent and furious <hi>Scythian</hi> by my magnanimity, and valour, the diſgrace and ſhame would have much reflected on the Emperour. At the ſame time I hazarded my life to all other adventures and dangers. At the taking of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> and of <hi>Pruſia,</hi> I was as active and bold as the meaneſt and deſperateſt Souldier: And when I thought of that prodigious action of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in the City of <hi>Oxidraques,</hi> I leaped on the walls of the Town, and thence deſcended with equall courage, and though I dare not ſay I had the valour of that famous <hi>Hero</hi> (of whom I ſpeak) and though I may be cenſured over raſh and bold, yet my confidence, and temerity were not without equall ſucceſſe: For (without vaine glory) I was then the chief and ſole cauſe of ſurpriſing that Town; and ſince then (may I ſpeake it without oſtentation) what eminent things have I not done in <hi>Europe</hi> againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as wel as in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Hungary?</hi> Wherein I have been a fortunate inſtrument, if not of vanquiſhing the <hi>Christians,</hi> yet of defending the <hi>Turks</hi> againſt their powerfull Armies. Do all theſe actions merit neglect, or (much leſs)
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96822:79"/>
perfidious infidelity? Or hath my fidelity been ſo great, and my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſo ſuccesfull, as to cauſe <hi>Amurath</hi> to be perfidious to his promiſes? Hath he no other reward (after his ſolemn engagements and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) but to uſurp the Kingdome of my <hi>Father,</hi> to exile the Queen my Mother, to poyſon my Brothers, and likewiſe to deſign me to bee an Illuſtrious ſlave? And not to ſuffer me longer to live; then I might ſerve his advantages, and by the conduct of Wars be able to defeate his enemies, and eſtabliſh his Throne? Doe you beleeve (after ſuch Treaties as theſe) that I can commit any act of Injuſtice in failing of my faith to one who ſo baſely and barbarouſly abuſed our royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily? Yet (perhaps) you will tell me, that <hi>Falſhood is a thing ſo deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as not to be excuſed, much leſſe justified.</hi> If that rule and maxime be generall, and admits no exception, the Military art muſt loſe great part of it ſelf. Then there wil be no farther uſe of Stratagems, nor Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcadoes; then Towns ſhould never be ſurpriſed, nor the Enemies interrupted with Alarums; then there would bee no Combats in the night, nor any occaſion of Spies; we needed not feign Retreats to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage an Enemy to fight, but it would be neceſſary to number the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of both parties, to make the combats equall; and Judges would be expedient in the Camp as well as at a Combat of Barriers, or Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; to ſee that the Sun were not more ſplendent in the eyes of the one, then of the other: Admit this abſurdity and evill conſequences, there would be no need of Generals in Armies, but the valour of the vigorous and hardy Souldiers would be ſufficient to diſpute and gaine the Field, then the extraordinary prudence, and juditious experience of the greateſt Commanders would be uſeleſſe and impertinent. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother objection may ariſe, that theſe circumſtances of Warre, are not onely tollerable but juſt, and neceſſary, againſt declared enemies. To that I anſwer, <hi>Publick contracts betwixt Crowns are more ſacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable then agreements betwixt private perſons.</hi> And when an Emperour treateth with a Prince, and keepeth not his Parole, he forceth him to be his Enemy, and dareth him to the height of revenge by his perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious actions, which are not only reſented by my ſelf, but appear clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the world how much I have been injured, and abuſed by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath;</hi> for when my Father died, and <hi>Amurath</hi> had exiled the Queen (my mother) and had poiſoned my Brothers, in a fained manner, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Generoſity, he ſeemed inclinable to offer me the Crown of <hi>Albania</hi> with a reſerved intention, if I accepted of it, to ſeize upon my perſon, or to put me to death. Theſe injuſt provocations as they ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned quickly my apprehenſions, ſo they juſtifie me not to be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: And as for thoſe reproaches of perfidiouſneſs and Treaſon, they reflect fully on him who was ſo barbarous and falſe. As for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments (ever ſince I came to his Court) did the misfortunes of my condition any whit leſſen, or abate my courage? Might I not think af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many actions of valour and gallantry, that my thoughts promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mee to more high, and ſublime ſucceſſes? Ought hee not to have thought when he firſt uſurped the Kingdom of my Father, and put my Brothers to death, that he then effectively declared a War, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged my fidelity, which I might have owed him in the Quality of an Hoſtage; and that all theſe actions authoriſed my endeavours to revenge? Could not he underſtand that one whoſe ambition was ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

which is ſo violent in all generous perſons? But chiefly then when they are aſſured of a lawfull right to a Crown? Could he not foreſee that it was impoſſible for me to be faithful, or a friend to one who uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my Kingdom? <hi>All wars have not their Commencements from the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Heralds mouthes.

In theſe latter we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and defie our Enemie; he accepteth the defiance and anſwereth the challenge. But as for publick Enemies they make a Parley, and treat if they pleaſe; and Combats and Ceſſations of Arms, are actions equally voluntary <hi>Generals of Armies are ever masters of their wils regulated to no bounds nor circumſtances, but what ſerves theſe advantages.</hi> On theſe conſiderations <hi>Amurath</hi> might not think it ſtrange (after his Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Murther) if I ſhould attend all advantages, and become his open enemie. <hi>As for preparations of war (when Princes are in low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they are not alwaies viſible. And when one is reduced to a deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the deſigns are onely in the head, but no ingenious perſon can ſleep ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or reſt ſecurely, injured and removed from Soveraignty.</hi> And though I was in the power of mine enemie, without an Army, without a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, without intelligence from any of mine own Subjects, out of mine own Country, without a perſon that I might confide or truſt in, and without any reſiſtance to ſo great a deſign, as I harboured in my boſome (excepting the hopes of heaven, and mine own valour) yet, if <hi>Amurath</hi> had well obſerved my actions, he might have eaſily diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that I cheriſhed ſome great reſerves within my ſoul. He might have ſeen the violence of my deſires in a daily aſpiring after glory and renown, and he might have read (by the ſymptoms of my heart) plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my countenance, that I was not capable to renounce my right to the Throne, nor be contented to be a ſlave all my life, though never ſo glorious, That love and friendſhip which I made with the Officers and Souldiers of the Army, declared that I deſigned ſome noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe for my ſelf, and perceiving that I was not an unactive Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, it was impoſſible, but that he ſhould dream of my endeavours to revenge his Injuries. Let him then not blame any but himſelf, if his policy hath been anticipated, nor reproach me as perfideous, for my deſertion; of him 'twas his fault and injury, no crime of mine. For firſt, he ought to have been in preparation to prevent all danger: And as for my ſelf, I did nothing but what became an open and noble Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. It was doubtleſſe juſt in mee how to conſult, to re-conquer <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muraths</hi> Uſurpation, and by what way and means I might attain to the King my <hi>Fathers</hi> Throne. If I had diſcovered my diſcontents to his unjuſt proceedings, I had been in that moment made a Priſoner, and either ſtrangled or poiſoned the ſame day. If I had reſolved to ſend to my Subjects, and to the Inhabitants of <hi>Croye</hi> to require their aſſiſtance, my deſignes might have been diſcovered, and my Subjects thereby made more miſerable, and poſſibly leſſe uſefull, or elſe, from being Subjects (by this meanes) might have been terrified into enemies. Now to have an abſolute confidence in the love of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> ſouldiers, (with which they courted my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) was a thing of great danger in appearance; and to have debauched the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> guards, and with them to have marched to the <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> to implore their aide and ſuccours, was an attempt too curious and perillous to be effected, and if I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96822:80"/>
with them, it is uncertain, whether the Princes would have been willing or able to commence a War of ſo great importance, and to expoſe their lives and Eſtates, to hazard, to recover mine: And if they had been reſolute, the event might have been very doubtfull againſt ſo formidable an Enemy. I would then in this great juncture of misfortunes, propoſe a reſolution to my ſelf, to be the ſole <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan</hi> of my ſucceſſes; And if I ſurprized <hi>Amurath,</hi> and converted his Forces to my ſervice: I have not juſtly merited reproach and blame, but rather deſerved honour and renown. Seeing that I have not done any thing but by the rules of Juſtice, nor enterprized any deſign but what <hi>Amurath</hi> might expect, if ever able to recompence his injuries. The great Cheate, and uſurpation wherewith he affronted me in the eyes of all the World, prepared me to ſtudy revenge equall (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to his Cruelty, falſeneſſe and Vſurpations, onely with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, when <hi>Amurath</hi> baſely forfeited his Faith with me, he violated all rights of honour and juſtice; And what I have done, was on equall retortion to his merit, to which I was obliged, as bound by nature to revenge the death of my Brothers, the libertie of my Country, mine own glory: and of God alſo, <hi>who is Juſtice it ſelfe:</hi> And had I no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, but this laſt within my thoughts, may not I urge and aſſert (noble Captaines) that God was my Conductor in this action of revenge? Wherefore to have been faithfull to this <hi>Tyrant,</hi> (to whom I was not a Subject,) would not have onely Corroded my Conſcience, but diſhonoured that religion I profeſſe. And ſhould not I anſwer for my Subjects, if I ſuffered them to be allured to the errors of <hi>Mahumatiſm?</hi> And ſhall not I be culpable, and guilty of the demolition of all thoſe Altars. which the <hi>Turks</hi> have deſtroyed, and as criminous as if I had built thoſe <hi>Moſques,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Turks</hi> have filled thoſe Townes which belong to me? If I had longer ſerved <hi>Amurath,</hi> ſhould I not have made my own ſubjects greater Slaves, and ſo have contributed more aſſiſtance to the <hi>Turks;</hi> farther to deſtroy thoſe who adored the <hi>God</hi> of my Fathers? Think you that <hi>the Lord of Hoſts</hi> could endure, that he who had been favoured with ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good ſucceſſes, in warlike affaires, ſhould not imploy his beſt skill and ſtrength againſt theſe infidells? and by adventures to make themſelves <hi>Martyrs,</hi> if not <hi>Conquerors?</hi> Oh no, <hi>the chief eſt duty keeps us ſtrictly in our fidelity to our Altars.</hi> Beſides I am clearly abſolved from his reproaches, in the judgement of all the World: As for <hi>Amurath</hi> he had no rules of Conſcience, nor Religion to oblige his promiſes, but he could diſpenſe with all relations, though never ſo ſacred. But theſe obligations did not reſt on me, for I was brought an infant to his Court and he was engaged to my Father; which Conditions, did not (with his ſucceſſion) derive themſelves on me. Now if after all thoſe remarkable ſervices, before and ſince the death of my brothers, and thoſe memorable victories, which he gained, through my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells and valour in the reconqueſt of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> without much effuſion of his ſouldiers bloud; if he were not touched with honour, nor guided by reaſon: am I to be blamed if I exerciſe Juſtice to my ſelfe, which he would not deſigne to render me? or could I longer ſerve that Prince, who after ſo many eminent Atchievements of his Warres, complotted all waies and means for my deſtruſhion? Which to have undertaken publickly, might ſeem too dangerous, becauſe he knew
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96822:80"/>
I had gained much affection with the Souldies; And as for my impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment I was too well beloved and guarded, to be ſo ſurprized, and my previſions were more diligent then to be ſuddainly intrapped; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then poſſibility to kill me neither by ſword nor poiſon, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a third way, wherein hee aimed to diſpatch me more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Not long after our laſt return from victory, hee proclaimed a ſummons to all the Noble <hi>Heroes</hi> of his Empire, to attend his Court, where he made preparations for martiall exerciſes and famous <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:</hi> at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hich ſolemn meeting, he hoped that in the divers Combates wherein (poſſibly) I might make re-encounter, I might receive a foile diſhonourably, or fall fatally. (Brave Captaines) I vow to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, this Treaſon is not in the number of any that can be excuſed, and ſerveth my turne to be juſtly more active in revenge: When I diſcerned the depth of this perfidions action, as I was diſpatched with the Army into <hi>Hungary:</hi> I took my reſolutions not long to fight for mine Enemie <hi>Amurath,</hi> and began to think of fighting for my ſelf; I reſolved over my thoughts the power and intereſt of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and what it was to march before, and command an Army: Theſe Cogitations reflected on me with ſhame to my ſelfe, who had ſo long a time been faithfull to an infidell: I began to have a horrour, and to be diſſwaded from drenching my hands in <hi>Chriſtians</hi> blood: In my march, I approached near to valiant <hi>Huniades,</hi> who was a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in that Army, and he inſpired into my ears, what ſhame poſſeſſed his ſoul, marching under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Standard. Theſe diſcontents quickned my reſolutions; and when I found my opportunity, I quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Infantry, and withdrew from that Army: This is that which <hi>Amurath</hi> calls Treaſon; but 'twas a juſt reward for a mortall Enemie, whom (I acknowledge) I ſerved no longer, and whom I found would prove eternally faithleſſe and ingrate. After the defeat, I retreated into my own Kingdome; you received me honourably, aſſiſted me couragiouſly, to chaſe and deſtroy the Common Enemies. And was there any blackneſſe in this action? Did I contrive to take away the life of <hi>Amurath</hi> ignobly? or by ſuch baſe waies and meanes as he did mine? Did I invade his Empire as heuſurped my Kingdome? May it not be rather ſaid to the contrary, that revenge was never taken more gentely, and more juſtly. And ſince I have made the Conqueſt of my Kingdome, if I have continued the Warre, or refuſed the Treaties of peace from <hi>Amurath;</hi> it is not becauſe I love not peace, but becauſe I cannot find fidelity in that Prince, with whom I am to treat; And that his ends are not honourable, but to diſarme an Enemy, whom he feared, and ſo to ſurprize (if poſſible) his Credulity, who is not to be eaſily taken by ſpetious pretences. Do not I then rather deſerve the reputation of being faithfull, then perfidious? who ſo clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt truth to my Enemie? and yet (to judge a little more exactly of this proceeding) recall into your memory (valiant Captaines) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you, all thoſe circumſtances of my Comportment, when I was in the head of the Armies of <hi>Amurath,</hi> adventuring my life to inlarge his Conqueſts, and to advance his glory: had not you moſt friendly rebuked me in ſecret, and murmured againſt me, and (not diving into the bottome of my heart) doubted whether I deſerved to have been the Son of ſo excellent a <hi>Prince,</hi> and concluded that I had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> utterly; that the love of my Country was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96822:81"/>
and rooted out of my Soul, and conſequently, that I was not affected with any ſence of true nobleneſſe, and honour? And yet in your very repinings, you made <hi>Apologies</hi> for my actions, better then I knew how to make for ſelf: For you concluded that I had no other way to manifeſt my ſelf more clearly the Son of the <hi>King</hi> my <hi>Father,</hi> then by thoſe heroick actions, which I purſued in my imployment. The world will confeſſe, that <hi>men are not equally obliged to be as faithfull to perfidious Enemies as to faithfull Friends, to thoſe who exerciſe artifice, and and fraud, as to thoſe who love ſincerity.</hi> It is doubtleſſe great unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and baſeneſſe to forfeit faith, and break Parole by malice, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe or mercenary intereſt; but to be unfaithfull to a Traitor, to an Uſurper, to a Murderer, and to quit his ſervice for the recovery of a Crown and Kingdome, for the intereſt of a Country, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> if this deſertion may be cenſured perfideouſneſſe by <hi>Amurath,</hi> in my ſence, and in reaſon it rather deſerves <hi>Elogies</hi> and <hi>Panegyricks</hi> then injuries and reproaches. And if it be true, that <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate uſurpers advanced to eminent qualities, and attended with ſucceſſes, in time become acknowledged as legitimate Princes:</hi> Is it not more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and true, that that Prince (to whom a Crown doth effectually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain) deſerves the higheſt honour, who conquers and forceth it from his hands, who hath moſt unjuſtly, and tyrannouſly uſurped it? And are not all means uſed for the recovery allowed? and as for the act, doth it not rather merit the opinion of glory and renown, then the accuſation of a crime?

The intereſt of ones Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Religion are principall, and high concernments, and admit of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſome degrees.</hi> We read, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath been preſerved, when Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have preferred her honour and ſafety before the lives of their own children: But (ſome may ſay) this was unnaturall and a cruell act, yet the wiſe <hi>Romans</hi> not onely permitted, but commended thoſe <hi>Patriots</hi> who reverenced their Countrie with ſo great eſtimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their Children; and that which ſeemed cruelty, and inhumanity in private relations, appeared as a laudable ſacrifice when it ſerved (in this high obligation) to defend or protect ones Country. It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that thoſe generous Fathers have with great zeal and deep af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, moſt ſtoutly fought for the preſervation of their children, their liberties, lives, and honours (on other occaſions) and have not ſpared to hazard the laſt drop of their blood. But where the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ones Country is in competition with love to children, the publick intereſt hath ever prevailed moſt powerfully, and affection to children is leſs vigorous, and Fathers are encouraged to ſee their children die, when it is for the ſervice of the Republique, with leſs ſorrow, and regret; and ſuch actions merit leſs of blame, and more of glory. Now if Fathers are pardonable, expoſing their children to death, how tolerable is it for me to violate my Parole, for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preſervation of my Country? Yet you will tell me, that a <hi>Pagan</hi> example doth not neceſsarily produce a concluſion for a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> But if Heathens have thus proceeded for the defence of their Country, what may not <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do for the intereſt of their Religion? which bond is ſo ſacred, as it ought to be the end and aim of all their beſt endeavours: Beſides what is fit to regulate the Soveraign actions of Princes, but onely <hi>Religion,</hi> which <hi>confineth rules to their Policy, and</hi>

                  <hi>ought ever to ſit Preſident in their Counſells.</hi> On theſe Principles, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not of our pretences to fidelity, having endured ſo long a ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to obtain ſo good an end; And we believe and reſolve, that it is no diſhonour nor injuſtice to be unfaithfull to an <hi>infidell Prince,</hi> who hath given the occaſion by the violation of his Faith and Parole. Come on (brave Souldiers) then, let us march, without remorſe, and let us vanquiſh and deſtroy this common Enemy of Chriſtianity, and uſe all craft and art, as well as force of Armes. Let us not be ſo ſcrupulous as <hi>Alexander the great</hi> (that invincible Conqueror) we are not aſſured of his Fortune, nor of his Valour, and wee know certainly, that we have not his retinue and train: let us uſe all ſtratagems for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and be as active in the night as in the day; and if we van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh, the Sun will gloriouſly ſhew us the effects of our Conqueſts; and if we be worſted in our nocturnall and more ſecret attempts. the darkneſſe will give an umbrage, and obſcure our ſhame and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe; as well as hide our misfortunes. To conclude (Generous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines) we are reſolved to vanquiſh and effect our reſolutions, and to attain our Conqueſts; we muſt be heroick in our actions, danted with no oppoſition, nor neglecting any occaſion of advantage. Wherefore prepare your ſelves to be practicall in the military ſcience, that you may be as ſucceſsfull as valiant. For we are but feeble and few, and the enemies puiſſant, and numerous, and if we do not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe them as well as fight them, their vaſt multitudes will ſuppreſſe our Valour and Courage. Thus (valiant Captaines) you ſee that our deſignes are innocent and generous; and that infidelity it ſelf to a perfidious Tyrant (being well managed) may gain immortall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory.</p>

This Prince (through his incomparable valour) attempted many thouſand glorious actions, and effected wonders, to the amazement of that age wherein he lived: he defeated Armies, which for their vast multitudes could ſcarce be numbred; He dammed up that great Torrent which ſtopped not, till it had ravaged the moiety and greater part of the World; he cauſed one Emperor to die with ſhame, grief, and diſhonor; He forced <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond (who was the Conqueror of ſo many Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes) to teſtifie, by that exceſſive joy, which he conceived of his death the extraordinary fear he had of him during his life. And (not to flatter truth) this great Generall <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> was (doubtleſſe) the greatest <hi>Heroe</hi> of theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages. Yet (not to ſpeak partially) had not the intereſt of Religion been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, all the glory of his latter actions, could not have excuſed the violation of his Parole. For to face about and joyne with the Enemie, in a Battail to faigne a flight for fear as being too weak, and to defeat thoſe Troops that he commanded, to ſerve the Enemy, are Circumſtances ſo odious that they had neede of all the importance and Arguments of Chriſtianity to help them to plead for aſpecious pretence, and to Apologize.

               <p>All theſe reaſons (firſt alleadged) how can I with wiſdome quit my Kingdome of <hi>Polonie?</hi> And <hi>if ugly Ingratitude bee ſo monstrous a crime even amongst private perſons, how detestable and odious ſhould it appeare in the eyes of a Prince?</hi> who is in that ſublime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and ſo farre above others, as not onely obliged to gratifie and recompence Civilities, but to heape honours and multiply Favours freely on perſons capable of Princely bounty and Generoſity. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon then thoſe ſubjects, who ſo freely choſe me their King, and that Kingdome which is ſo abundant in peace, and plenty, cannot but affect my thoughts with much trouble, and perplexity.

where thoſe who recall me, feare me more then love me, or if they ſeem to love me, do it more for their own ends then my ſervice: And (Farther) where there are to be found as many Rebells as Subjects, and a civill Warre devouring the very heart of the Country, where in that great body no one part is intirely ſound, or free from the Epidemick diſeaſe of the State. Theſe conſiderations may retard and deterre my reſolutions from going to <hi>France.</hi> Beſides the Provinces of <hi>Poitou, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie, Dauphine</hi> and <hi>Languedock</hi> are in armes againſt me: Great ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhines, and hereſies are inſolently ſpread, and have generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and (perhaps) I may be forced to the endeavours of a new Conqueſt, before I may hope for a quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion of the Kingdome; and that (uſually) I ſhould be forced to make my entrance into the moſt Famous Townes of <hi>France,</hi> rather by the breaches which the Cannons might make, then by the Gates of the Townes, loyally lying open. And ſo, to march triumphantly, attended with ſuch joyfull acclamations as uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Princes in their freſh addreſſes, and entrances to their Crowns. Imagine you what a ſtrange and unwelcome alteration would that be, to quit a Kingdome wherein all the Subjects are in repoſe, and humble and affectionate towards their Prince, and to march into another, where the fields are overſtrewed with dead corpſes, where the greateſt part of the people deſerve rather the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Punition, then pardon, or the grace of Clemency, as having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, (and that irrepentantly) the juſt authority of all divine and humane rights.

In theſe conſiderations, it is evident to all the World, that whether I hold the Crown of <hi>Polonie</hi> or the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> the tenure is chiefly and ſolely from <hi>God.</hi> And as for the People of both Kingdomes, they ſwell with equall affections in my heart: And whether I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in <hi>Polony,</hi> or advance towards <hi>France,</hi> I am to be as a common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Parent to the Country, and without reſpects of either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in peace, or hazard in War, it is my duty to regard what is moſt juſt and equitable; and as to either Kingdome what may be more commodious, and more glorious. Let us ſee then (I beſeech you) whether it be more reaſonable to quit a Kingdom where my preſence is neceſſary, to prevent a War, or to go to another, where it may be very doubtfull, whether my perſon may recover and eſtabliſh a peace. <hi>It is not permitted to effect any evill, though with a good end, much leſſe in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ſo uncertain an aſſurance. Thoſe famous Acts which great and hardy ſpirits attempt, in uſurpations of Empires and Kingdomes, are no leſſe crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous before God, then the more common horrid crimes are amongſt men.</hi> And is it not as great an injury to robb a King from a Kingdom, as a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from a King? It hath arrived and faln out ſometimes, that Souldiers have forſaken their Captaines, and Captaines their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, and Generalls their Princes and Maſters, becauſe they have been either baſe or falſe; But for a generous and prudent Prince to have quitted his Faithfull Subjects, and to make a choice of others, of whoſe fidelity he hath had no experience, but rather danger, whether they would prove dutifull and loyall, is an accident, which (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) hath never happened, unleſſe in this example of my perſon. Notwithſtanding the tenderneſſe and equity, which cauſeth a Father to leave his Children, who are not in danger to make haſt and runne to deliver thoſe that are in eminent peril, encourageth my reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in this Conjuncture, and invites me to leave them, now being more proſperous and happy, and more able to ſuccour others who are very miſerable. When the Sea is calme, every ordinary Pilot doth preſume to work at the Helm, or guide the ſhip: but when the Sea is rough, and the VVaves wanton and furious; the moſt skillfull Seaman obſerves the Compaſſe, and ſteeres the Courſe. It is he who chiefly grapples with the tempeſt, when all the company (with trembling eyes and eares) attend his Counſells, and his motions: It is he on whom they depend to preſerve the Ship from Rockes, and protect the Veſſell from the fury of the Rowling VVaves, and (at laſt) to bring them ſafely to the Port, and Harbour. Do not you then ſo much admire, if you heare me preferre VVarre before Peace, and rather expoſe my ſelfe to troubles, then to perpetuate that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, which I doe now enjoy. <hi>Polonie</hi> is furniſhed with many Noble Perſonages, who can eaſilie preſerve her in that good Eſtate, wherein the Kingdome is now eſtabliſhed: But Faire <hi>France</hi> now is rich in nothing but broiles and troubles, which are (at preſent) ſo highly inflamed, as probably not to be extinguiſhed without the approach of my perſon. <hi>A Prince is a star in himſelf ſo glorious, that it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes obſcures by the beams of Majeſty (though ariſing a far off) thoſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You ſee then my reſolutions are not unreaſonable, and that a Prince in equity is not onely obliged to live where he can have moſt honour, eaſe, and plenty, but where hee may ſtill increaſe his renowne, and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly exerciſe his royall dignity. And whereas it may be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Polonie</hi> may fall into the miſeries of War, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome evils attend that Kingdome, by reaſon of my motions, and advance towards <hi>France;</hi> I anſwer, <hi>the Generall of an Army, who hath given and gained a Battail, is not reſponſible</hi> (by Martiall diſcipline) <hi>for the loſſe of three or four thouſand men ſlaine in that re-encounter;</hi> and the Cryes of the Widdows and Orphans (on this occaſion) cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Trophies and Triumphs of Victory and Joy, nor extinguiſh the Bonefires of Exultation. Where (on the contrary) a private Captaine having raſhly, or imprudently expoſed his Company to great danger, and to no purpoſe, and without order) hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been ſentenced not onely to loſe his place, but alſo his life. Thus 'tis true, the leaſt circumſtance of diſhonour and imprudence changeth the face of things. Now in Politick affairs it is ſufficient if the deſign be reaſonable, though the effects ſucceed not; the chiefe Commander, though failing in the enterpriſe, is free from blame: <hi>Good Counſels, and good Intentions (though honeſt) are not alwaies fortunate;</hi> and we are not to judge of the actions of Princes by ſucceſſes and uſuall events.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding I ſhall further adde, that my removing to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> may contribute greater advantage and ſafety to the State of <hi>Polonie:</hi> For thinke you not that the Neighbour Princes will continue their power with more moderation, or be in more fear, when they ſhall underſtand that he who was King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſhall become abſolute Maſter of the firſt, and greateſt Kingdome in Chriſtendom? And that he and his Allies may bee therefore more formidable to all the Princes in the earth? <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great commanded Subjects (though remote and diſtanced) in the fartheſt parts. The Senators of <hi>Rome,</hi> who never budged out of that <hi>Royall City,</hi> made intire Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to tremble, which were no nearer the Capitoll then <hi>Cracovia</hi> is to <hi>Paris.</hi> If that great Conqueror <hi>Alexander</hi> quitted the pleaſant ſcituation or <hi>Macedonia</hi> for the great riches and glory of <hi>Perſia,</hi> wee may conclude then that <hi>Dangers are companions of honour, and agree with illuſtrious minds.</hi> On this account I may be permitted to leave <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie,</hi> to goe and raign in <hi>France.</hi> But you will tell me, the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> murmured when <hi>Alexander</hi> reſolved to leave them, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced toward <hi>Perſia.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Alexander</hi> aimed at the glory of that Empire, who was a ſtranger and no <hi>Perſian;</hi> but I have a more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall right to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> which is not onely an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and caſuall Intereſt, to ground my expectations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, in the Government of that Illuſtrious Kingdome.

in my ſoul, how to deport my ſelfe in an equall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soveraignty and favour to both Kingdomes. <hi>It is not valour alone that cauſeth Princes to be renowned, but bounty, ſweetneſſe, gratitude, and moderation.</hi> Virtues which make no great noiſe, but like deep ſtreames glide ſmoothly and gently, gain the Subjects hearts, makes the Soveraigne more glorious, his Government more acceptable, and his renown more immortall: And the Hiſtorians have not been leſſe induſtrious in the deſcription of the paſſages of <hi>Granica,</hi> and the Battail of <hi>Arbella,</hi> then of the great Armies of the <hi>Macedonian Conqueror</hi> over the numberleſſe Forces of <hi>Darius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo, why may I not expect the reward of Honour? being ſo generous as not to reſolve abſolutely to quit thoſe who love mee; and ſtill reſerve ſo much Equity and Juſtice due to them for their Election of me to bee their King, that I may not force them to repent of their Royall Favour: And if I bee ſo bounded in my moderation as rather to make choice of hardſhip and trouble with hopes of doing better ſervice, then of dalliance (in the abundance of delicious plenty) where the Princes and Nobles are as fortunate and happy as they can wiſh themſelves; On this ground I make my reſolution to advance towards thoſe parts, where true glory leads and conducts me, and every ſtep of my march (even from the firſt motion) ſhall be with deſign of equal honour to <hi>Polonie</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> towards which wee ſhall not make more haſte to ſearch out the delicacies and pleaſures of that Kingdome, but propoſing a Method and courſe of Moderation, reſolve to expoſe our ſelfe to the fury of a Civill Warre, with hopes to recover an eſtabliſht Peace in that diſtempered and divided State.

               <p>It is not then mine own will that induceth me to leave my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but a ſupernall, and heavenly intereſt that chiefly ſnatcheth mee from them: And <hi>Morall Generoſity is obliged to give place, and yeeld to Divine Policie:</hi> And ſince (to ſpeake rationally) my Birth hath made mee a King, as to this latter reſpect, I cannot with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Honour quit the Priviledges of my Birth-right, and being advanced to ſo glorious a Crowne, I am not only obliged to Reign, but to rule with Juſtice, and ſo to ſupport that great luſtre, and glory which is derived on me from my Predeceſſors. As for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Elected Kings, the Succeſſors are not obliged to preſerve the honour of thoſe who ruled before them; but Princes who come to their Crownes by Inheritance, have Kings their Fathers, as well as their Predeceſſors; and being naturally deſcended from them, they are not onely to endeavour to bee glorious, but likewiſe engaged to ſupport the ſplendour and renown of their Anceſtors. And the Scepter of <hi>France</hi> hath been borne up by ſo many famous Princes, that as it were ignominious in me to refuſe ſo glorious a Birth-right, ſo it were ignoble not to endeavour by a ſignal emulation, to imitate (if not exceed) the chiefeſt Virtues of thoſe Illuſtrious Princes;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96822:85"/>
which if I ſhould not undertake, my neglect would prove an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious declaration to all the world, that I tacitely renounced a Royall Right and Scepter, and was unworthy or unable to weare ſo ſplendent a Crowne and Diademe, and had not in me the Valour and Virtues of mine Anceſtors: I muſt part, part (I ſay) my deare Friends) though with great griefe and reluctancie from thoſe who have received us with ſo great joy, and whoſe hearts are overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſorrow, at our preparations to leave them. Oh Heavens! what an unparallel'd conjuncture am I falne into? I ſpeake of my departure from <hi>Poland,</hi> but doe not well know how to finde out the way and meanes, being ſo inviron'd with the affections of ſo many thouſands, from whoſe vigilant love I can ſcarce withdraw my ſelf. My conſultations are onely with my ſelf, and you my Friends; and I am well aſſured that he who had ſo univerſall a conſent, and generall acclamations, when hee was crowned, ſhall not have one vote or voice to quit his Crown: If hee ſhall referre his reſolution to the publick deliberation of the people. I can eaſily (if I will) ſtirre up all the Kingdome of <hi>Polonie</hi> into Armes, and ingage them not to permit my departure. So that I can ſay, I am free, and yet a Priſoner, and that which ſeemes more cruell, I cannot complaine of my Guards, which have ſo great paſſion to obey my commands, that (on the contrary) I am obliged to love them. And now (after all this conflict, and debate, I muſt reſolve to leave them, and that for ever: And yet (which is more cruell) without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them notice, or ſo much as ſaying, adieu my Subjects, my Friends. Whoever read of an accident ſo ſtrangely tempered as this of mine is? I am gratefull, and thankfull in my ſoul to the <hi>Polanders</hi> for their favours, and yet I muſt appear to them, and all the world, uncivill and monſtrous.</p>
               <p>Fortune, in this occaſion, ſeems to overthrow, and beat downe all her former favours, and hath rather impoveriſhed, then inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I could rather wiſh that ſhe bad never preſented me with the Crowne of <hi>Polonie,</hi> then ſo to have ſnatcht, and raviſht mee from thence. But (after all this) I know that <hi>Kings neither live, nor Reign for themſelves,</hi> there is a fatal Law and Decree, which guideth them as wel as inferiour private perſons; and they are as well bound up to the rules of obedience, as Subjects to their Princes wills and pleaſures. Policy doth often oppoſe Religion, but the latter ought to bee the chiefeſt Councellour of a King. Juſtice and Clemencie require things, which ſeeme intirely different; the love of peace, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of true Renowne familiarly oppoſe one another: to be a King, and in that Royall Quality more illuſtrious, is certainly to be ſomething above an ordinary perſon. Bee not you then ſtartled at the diverſity of my reaſons, or difficulty of my reſolutions in this point. <hi>The paths which lead Princes to ſupremacie, are not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly beaten, as that they may not erre, and deviate from the right way;</hi> then principally when the affaires are ſublime, important, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
               <p>Examples in Antiquitie demonſtrate the truth in this caſe, for to bee a King by election, and to be a King by birth, and to bee beloved of the firſt Subjects; and miſapprehended and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated (for the moſt part) by others, to leave thoſe who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96822:86"/>
faithfull, and to addreſſe to others who are tumultuous, inſolent, and uncivill: to abandon the delights of peace, and to make choice of the affaires of Warre; not to be able to quit the faithfull without griefe, nor to relieve and ſuccours others without certain infamy and danger: To conclude, to be conſtrained to flye from a Kingdome, for fear of being forced to raigne Soveraignly: Theſe are ſuch different varieties of concernments, as humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence rarely or never conſulted with before: and in which, the deepeſt policy will prove too ſhallow, to ſound the bottome, and make a reſolution, what to chooſe or leave. But in the extremity and ſtreight, my owne reaſon, and thoughts of true honour, muſt be our guides, what courſe to ſteere, and no other Pilots (how skillfull ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) can be uſefull to me in this nick of ſo great importances. I doubt not but that my return into <hi>France</hi> may indanger to change, &amp; alienate the affection of my ſubjects in <hi>Poland</hi> (perhaps) into the quality of as great hatred as it was of kindneſſe. For <hi>it is the courſe and effect of love once irritated, to turn into fury.</hi> But if this misfortune ſhould attend me, I ſhall (at laſt) gain this advantage, that poſterity may better judge of the ſweetneſſe and temper of my domination, and Reigne by their reſentment: and, that election and choice that they made of me, wherein they might (poſſibly) have been abuſed. But my heart hath been utterly incapable of unworthineſſe, or unthankfullneſſe to loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and faithfull Subjects.

So that his Management (upon this occaſion) ſeemeth to be moſt judicious, and his choice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, and both theſe were confirmed to him, by the testimonies of glory, and triumph, which did meet him, and attend on him on the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> and ſeemed to promiſe to him a proſperous Raigne, accompanied with much Felicity. But, (oh the vanity of all Earthly Contentations) this temperate Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and fair Kingdome, found no entertainment for her King, but outrages, and tempeſtuous broiles: The <hi>Queen</hi> his Mother (who ſo paſſionatly loved the Duke of <hi>Anjou)</hi> had no kindneſſe for him when he was King of <hi>France.</hi> The People civilized at ſome ſeaſons, at his approach, became more barbarous then <hi>Scythians:</hi> they endeavoured to aſperſe his honour, and aſſaulted his life, and (at laſt) forced him from his Throne, to which he never made (after his misfortune) a re-aſcent: his Reign was almoſt as bloody as that of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors: before his death he diſcern'd himſelf the object of the Peoples ſcorne, and <hi>odium,</hi> whom formerly they had ſo hugged in their affections, and extolled with admiration: and after a grappling with many miſchievous reencounters, he was unfortunately aſſaſſinated by an abominable Monster, a Jacobin Frier. <hi>Kings by this example may learne to humble themſelves before the Throne of the great King of Kings; who elevateth them to their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>

That God which foundeth, eſtabliſheth, and preſerveth Empires, can ſhake their foundations, diſſipate their forces, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their ſtrength at his pleaſure; and no earthly power is ſo firm and puiſſant, but he can as eaſily break to ſhivers as a Potters Veſſell. A Royal Scepter is but a Reed in compariſon of that Iron Rod where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God chaſtizeth: And when Kings are thruſt out of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Graſhoppers, and Frogs, ſhall prove enemies too formidable for their reſiſtance: And there is nothing ſo feeble, amongſt all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but ſhall be ſtrong enough (when God is diſpleaſed) to ruinate and deſtroy them.</hi> Let not then great ones affie in their ſubtilty, nor truſt <hi>in uncertaine Riches, nor in the numbers of Forces and Armies.</hi> Theſe are things ſo farre from ſecuring Princes, that they doe not onely fail them, but ſerve to pull down their authority. Theſe attendants are of a mortall, and mutable condition, and no ſecurity is to be ſought, or ſetled <hi>but in God alone, who is unchangeable.</hi> And to this purpoſe <hi>the Morals of the Evangile are better for Princes then the profoundeſt rules of</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>and the deepeſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians;</hi> and the dependency of a bleſſing from heaven tranſcendeth all Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, or humane Counſell. <hi>He who takes care for the Birds of the air, forgets not Princes;</hi> but when they first offend and forget their Maker, their ruin is (probably) not far off. To conclude, this name of <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> transfers me to another of that name, <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England,</hi> who found himſelf much ſtreightened what to reſolve; for having elevated <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> to the Throne, and having repudiated <hi>Katherin,</hi> he found himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to put her to death for her Falſhood, and Incontinency: he ſeemed to ſtruggle with many difficulties, which gave a check to his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but over-ruled by theſe reaſons following, he cauſed the Lady to die, whom he profeſſed to have loved more dearly then his own Soul.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was Averſe from their Councels, and yeilded to my paſſion, when I reſolved to advance <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> to my Throne, ſo I ought no more to be attentive to their Importunities, who endeavoured to perſwade me not to ſacrifice to my revenge, this obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I cauſed Crown'd. For it is expedient that this victime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate her crime and mine: it being certain that I have been no leſs culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in too much loving and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, then ſhe hath been falſe and unworthy towards me. The nature of her crime is of ſuch deformity, that it is not capable of the beams of Clemency. I am well aſſured that <hi>Agu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Caeſar,</hi> who made this vertue to appear ſo illuſtrious towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of his reign, repented of nothing more, but that he had elected the puniſhment of Exile for the correction of the evil inclination of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Julia,</hi> and had not been more ſevere to ſo notorious a crime: which is moſt odious in any of that ſex, but more intolerable and impardonable in a <hi>Queen</hi> then any others. If I were permitted to give that ſin a name, I ſhould be much troubled how to deſcribe it; it is ſo black and foul. Had <hi>Anne</hi> no other umbrage to have ſhadowed her, and prevented her from that ſhameleſs choice, modeſty (the common protection of that ſex) might have guarded her chaſtity: and ſhe might have been perſwaded, that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a ſpotleſs converſation would have proved the greateſt ornament and beauty to her; without which, beauty it ſelf becomes but an object of ſcorn and averſion, a looſe and impudent garb provoking rather an <hi>odium</hi> and deteſtation, then love and admiration: And as Ladies have nothing elſe to obſerve and attend more then vertue and modeſty, and what may beſt and moſt grace their Converſation; ſeeing their thoughts are not cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the conduct of Armies, the charge of the Magiſtracy, nor the hard ſtudy of Learning and Policy: their whole duty ought to be entirely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a modeſt and vertuous comportment. It is that which renders them moſt amiable and lovely, and continues daily a Creation of new Charms, to honor and adore their beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:96822:89"/>
But beſides this general reaſon, there are many others, which juſtifie her actions to have been moſt deteſtable: Shee was not only of that ſex, to whom Chaſtity and Modeſty is a Vertue neceſſary and eſſential, but above theſe degrees; ſhe was a <hi>Queen,</hi> wife to a famous <hi>King;</hi> a Prince, who paſſionately loved her, and ſo honoured her as to put a Crown upon her head; towards which, had not her Princes favour invited her ſhe durſt not have preſumed to have lifted up her eyes, <hi>A Throne is a place of Majeſty, ſo highly elevated, that as on the Sun, it is not to be lookt on by a Subject, but with ſtupor and admiration; and a Crime approaching towards it, is not to be endured.</hi> That place is ſacred, and not to be prophaned; ſo baſe, ſo foul an attempt to come near ſo illuſtrious a preſence, cannot, ought not to be excuſed. Kings in their greateſt weakneſs may not digeſt ſo foul an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: There are alwayes ſome pretences at hand to ſhadow and cover faults and errors. If Princes be debonaire, they are flattered as peaceful and gentle; if weak, as kind and indulgent; if cruel, they are accounted more ſevere and jealous of their Authority; if they have the Art to rule and reign, they are eſteemed ſubtle; to have much of the Fox, and to be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Thus Kings in their authority are attended with Apologies, and their Power brings to them fair gloſſes for all their actions: But if a Queen loſe her honour and reputation, there is no cure for ſuch a wound, there is nothing to be ſaid more, but that ſhe deſerves to be removed from the Throne and caſt into her Tomb; where her crimes and infamie may be buried with her: which were the more notorious in her, becauſe ſhe was advanced from ſo low a Quality, to be ſo great a Princeſs: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtained her honour, nothing can be able to expiate her offence, but the ſtreams of her own blood. The love of her Prince was not paſſionate to an ordinary degree, but to a kind of Idolatry; and conſequently, her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſhould have reſpected the majeſty of the Throne. And if the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of her husband had not been ſufficient to have obliged her to Vertue, and Fidelity; the abundance of his ardent affection might have charmed her to mutual tenderneſs: And if this paſſion could not prove predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in her ſoul; the relations of her husband, her ſervant, and her King, who had courted her with a Crown, might have inveloped entirely, and ſwallowed up her ambition. And ſhould not all theſe Engagements have merited her acknowledgments; and preſerved her from defiling the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bed, and ſo to diſhonour her ſelf and diſoblige her Prince? No, all theſe obligations were too feeble for this inconſtant and immodeſt wretch. This woman advanced to be a Queen, though the Soveraign miſtreſs of my ſoul whom I crowned gloriouſly with mine own hands, became an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel to my favours, and her own faith; and fell ſo low, that ſhe lodged within the Cabinet of her heart, thoſe unworthy perſons, who deſerve not to be named, but as to make up an Aggravation in their mutual offences. Shee (I ſay) who knew well with what Conteſtations I wreſtled to obtain her Coronation, and ſaw to what dangers and ſcorn I expoſed my ſelf for the love of her: Neither conſidered the Laws of God nor man; ſlighted the peace and proſperity of my Kingdom, regarded not the repoſe of my People, but ſtained her own honour, and my content and Glory. Although I repudiated Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> who was a vertuous and Immaculate Lady; and cauſed her Death by this ſecond marriage, whereby I drew upon me the rage and envy of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> irritated the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſeemed to ſcorn the Alliance with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> propoſed to me by the Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi> my Creature and Favourite, whom I diſobliged and provoked
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96822:89"/>
to deſert my ſervice; by whoſe Miniſtry and conduct, I ſo mightily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered: Though the exigencie of Affairs tranſported my paſſion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured my reaſon; ſo that I became A diſturber of Religion, Sacrilegious, violent, and cruel to my Subjects; and grew ſo reſolved as to ſerve mine own luſts and Inclinations, cauſing a violent change; wherewith tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I cruelly put to death one of the chiefeſt of all my Subjects, the Lord Chancellor Sir <hi>Thomas More;</hi> and to proſtrate all things in my kingdom to the pleaſure of my ſelf and Miſtreſs; and therefore renouncing Juſtice and paternal tenderneſs, preferred <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter of <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> before <hi>Mary</hi> the daughter of Queen <hi>Katharine;</hi> And ſo carrying on my deſigns in a tempeſt of Paſſion, I removed all things out of the way that might ſeem to reſiſt and oppoſe my expectations: I puniſhed ſome with exile, others with impriſonment, and ſome with death: Yet after all theſe Circumſtances and pledges of my love, this baſe and ingrate perſon razed me out of her affection; forgot the debt ſhe owed me, and which ſhe ought to have paid to her own honour, and violently forced me (which neither honour nor reaſon could reſiſt) to cauſe that head cut off which I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly crowned. But (O heavens) can King <hi>Henry</hi> poſſibly conſent, that ſhe, whom he conducted to the Throne, ſhould aſcend a Scaffold to loſe her head? And that ſhe who kept my heart ſoveraignly in her power, ſhould ſubmit and lay down the greateſt Beauty in my Kingdom to be ſtruck off by the hand of an Executioner? Oh no, theſe my thoughts are terrible, the way forlorn, though the crimes are odious; the perſon is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whom I once ſo honoured; and cannot be ſentenced to die, but with much regret. It will be a ſad ſpectacle to ſee her bathed in her own bloud whom I have ſo tenderly embraced; will it not be ſufficient to impriſon her perſon, who hath ſo wantonly abuſed her liberty? May not her life in a Priſon afflict her, and better teach her the difference which ſhe enjoyed in the liberty and honour of a Throne? Will not her remorſe for her faults be to her as bitter as death, and prove a Correction ſevere enough? 'Tis true, this uſe may be made of her alteration: But ſhall I let ſlip or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to dye my former Princely reſolutions? No, I know too well, that <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended honour grows implacable;</hi> her ſatisfactions are impoſſible, ſhe muſt periſh, my Injuries muſt have revenge; and her death muſt prepare my better repoſe, when ſhe ſhall ceaſe to be alive. Time will raze her Image out of my memory, and then I ſhall be more free from the paſſions of love and fear. Beſides, the reſolutions which I take, are not only the effects of revenge, but rules and reaſons of Policy: For <hi>there are a ſort of enemies, who either ought not to be accuſed, or if they be, they are not to be pardoned:</hi> And <hi>prudent Princes are obliged to conſider, whether thoſe whom they pardon can be ever able to hurt and offend them.</hi> Policy teacheth them to depend more ſecurely on their own power, then on a penitent offenders promiſe. And may I, in this caſe, regard the deſires of <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> and ſo diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her crime, and let her paſs unpuniſhed? Or having accuſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned this offendor, were it not greater policy to deſtroy her? When I ſo much doted, and adored her, ſhe might have found opportunity to have been malitious or deſperate, to have uſed Poniard or Poiſon to my perſon: Perhaps ſhe may make an eſcape out of Priſon, and (with her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans) levy Arms againſt me in ſome part of my kingdom. But you will tell me that <hi>Anne</hi> is committed to an inacceſſible Tower, where the Guards are as faithful and couragious as vigilant, that ſhe is rather hated then loved of my Subjects; who never had the leaſt approbation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96822:90"/>
                  <hi>odium</hi> and ſcorn for her marriage, and therefore (probably) ſhe may be leſs dangerous and offenſive. Yet the Tower where ſhe is committed, though ſtrong, may be too weak to keep her: As for the guards, they may be ſuborned and corrupted. The Artifice and Inchantments of a woman, and ſhe a Queen, and miſerable, and unfortunate, are temptations too apt to provoke her to all malicious inventions, and hardly to be reſiſted in her ſex (too inclinable to miſchief and revenge:) Beſides, Compaſſion opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the moſt obdurate hearts; And <hi>Female tears, like ſoft drops (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſtilling) will in time work into tempers as hard as ſtones.</hi> And (I believe) it is far more eaſie to guard ſecurely the wildeſt Tygers and moſt Savage Lions, then a fair and beautiful Lady: Theſe fierce creatures are ſafe if their Cages and Dens be ſtrongly traverſed with iron bars, ſtrong dores, and locks: But <hi>a Beauty, the more ſhe is loaded with chains, the more ſhe moveth her Keepers and Guards to compaſsion:</hi> Her tears (in her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) her groans and ſighs will prove no leſs poſſible to corrupt and inchant her Jailors, then the greateſt rewards and recompences: and therefore her hopes will be freſh every day to gain her enlargment, if not from my cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, yet from her corruptible and compaſſionate Guards. Beſides, ſince her advance to the Throne, ſhe hath had golden opportunities to heap up vaſt ſums of treaſure; which (perhaps) ſhe hath ſecretly prepared to ſupply her misfortunes, in caſe they ſhould aſſault her. And 'tis true, Keys made of gold do often open iron gates; and it is to be ſuſpected that beams of beauty, attended with ſad complaints of injury, ſighs and tears, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and preſents, may open ſtrong dores, intoxicate vigilant Souldiers, and by female craft and ſubtile deviſes, <hi>Anne</hi> may procure her liberty, and ſo gain more opportunity to endeavour miſchief, and raiſe future troubles. I know well that my people love her not, and if ſhe could eſcape her Priſon, ſhe could not but with much difficulty find any ſuccour or Azile, yet my jealouſie and reaſon tells me, that if the people have no kind neſs for her, the Grandees of my Kingdom would be glad to countenance and engage in a Faction with her. And I do not think it poſſible, that if this perfidious and ingrate ſoul ſhould addreſs to any part of my kingdom, but that ſhe might endanger the moſt faithfull of my ſubjects either to compaſſion or compartnerſhip in ſome new and diſloyal deſign againſt me: my reign hath not been ſo free and calm from troubles, but that a little breath of potent malice and diſcontent might quickly ſtir up the Waves and Billows of violent Commotions. And if this fair Beauty ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate her ſelf to the moſt loyal Governor within any Forts of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; when he ſhould ſee a Queen at his feet, with tears in her eyes, blub bering Beauty it ſelf, and a heart ready to break with diſcontent; breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out nothing but ſighs and groans, he could not poſſibly but be apt to believe, and then tenderly to relieve a diſtreſſed Lady; The ſame force and ſweetneſs inchanting his heart, which bewitched mine. From this tenderneſs, kindneſs and reſpect would ſpring; and from that, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſires to ſerve her: And then Hope and Ambition, the two wings that ſupport new aſpirings, might transform loyalty to obſervation of <hi>Anne:</hi> And this error (not reſiſted) nor weighed in the ballance of Reaſon) may change a loyal Subject of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, into a Vaſſal and Slave of <hi>Anne Bullen.</hi> The confuſions and ruines of Kingdoms arrive not always through the ambition of Neighbour-Princes, or through the hatred or diviſion of the People; <hi>Fond love and violent paſsions have their ſhare often in great diſorders;</hi> And they who extinguiſh not the ſparks of theſe fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

flames grow high) are apt to put Kingdoms into as great Combuſtion, as the moſt formidable Invaſions. We reſolve then to take a courſe with this enemie; and diſarming her, render her incapable not to offend us. The ſuborning of my Guards, and ſeducing my Subjects, is not only the diſſervice that ſhe may prove capable to effect: for who knows (if I ſuffer her to live) but that in proceſs of time, I may grow ſo feeble, as to dote on that beauty, which I ſo much admired, and be inamoured with her; and admitting her diſcourſe, be charmed with her Syrenian voice? And yeilding a delightfulneſs to her company, be ſo tranſported with affection, as to forget all her Injuries and Treaſon, which never appeared in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance nor deceitful looks. She is ſtill fair and lovely; and though ſhe hath loſt her proſperitie, hath guarded her beautie: and my heart hath been ſo long ſubject to her Laws, that ſhe may have a poſſibility to be as great a Tyrant over me as ever; and then (in that condition) what revenge might not her malice execute? Judge then (my Lord) how great would be my ſhame, and how odious my infamy; what my People would ſay, and how bitterly murmur: certainly excuſing her as innocent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning my ſelf as moſt Tyrannical and unjuſt. If I ſhould admit of ſuch a viciſſitude, and ſuffer <hi>Anne</hi> to be admitted to my company, and to return to the Throne. No, (my Lord) we reſolve not to expoſe royal Majeſty to any ſuch unworthy hazard and adventure. That which I permitted and approved in my firſt grace and favour, is an example warranted by many Illuſtrious Princes, and not excepted againſt by the moſt ſcrupulous and moſt vertuous Moraliſts. The Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> courted <hi>Athenais</hi> to his royal Throne, who was the daughter of an humble and grave Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: This was not the firſt time when Beauty was crowned by the hands of Love and Fortune; yet the ſame <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> upon a meer ſuſpition and ſlight conjecture, made no difficulty to put <hi>Paulina</hi> his wife to death, whom he had loved ſo paſſionately, and to exile the Empreſs notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the appearance of her Innocency. It is ſo true that Purity and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity are ſo abſolutely neceſſary in Princes. If <hi>Theodoſius</hi> then thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with his <hi>Athenais:</hi> What? may I not juſtifie my ſevereſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> being one whoſe crime is notorious; and thoſe who were her Partizans now impriſoned equally guilty? Whoſe crimes were as friendleſs as foul; and could not find an Interceſſor for Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; much leſs Orators and Advocates to plead for their Juſtification. Let us not forget then (in this re-encounter) how there ought to be no tenderneſs for odious offenders; and that the glory of a State ought to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal aim and end of Royal Actions. If this injurious and unworthy Queen had made a Faction, and publickly raiſed a party againſt me in my Kingdom, or had attempted my perſon openly, her crime might have been more pardonable: I might have lookt upon her as a perſon of greater ſpirit, and therefore leſs capable to brook the conceit of an injury; and poſſibly her reconciliation might have been more ſafe and glorious: <hi>All ſubjects who make revolts (either ſeduced or being fomenters) are not alwayes exterminated.</hi> Thoſe who adventure in Conſpiracies and (in their black deſigns) aim at taking away the life of the Prince, do not alwayes periſh; there are reaſons why (in ſome Conjunctures) crimes are wink'd at, and diſſimulated, and ſometimes pardoned as well as puniſhed. But as for the uglineſs of this offence, it hath not only injured the Prince, but prophaned his Throne, diſhonoured Royalty, violated Divine and Humane Lawes, and by her <hi>Inceſt</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> ſhe hath ſo corrupted the Fountain that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96822:91"/>
the ſtreams will glide with nothing but ſhame and ſin from age to age, to the laſt poſterity. This is an evil which cannot be tollerated, an Ulcer ſo incureable, that nothing but her life and bloud (which cauſed it) can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: all other remedies are unſerviceable, and not to be adminiſtred. In this occurrence it is aequitable that I be Judge and Accuſer in the ſame thing: and 'tis as abſolutely neceſſary that I abandon pity and forget all former affection; and cloſe mine eyes from the rayes of that Beauty, and my ears from that Harmonious voice which ſo mightily had inchanted me. It is for this reaſon that I reſolve not to look on that lovely object, whoſe crimes had ſo ſoiled her former purity, that I ſhall raze her memory out of my heart: and (at leaſt) by that means cauſe, that poſterity ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my ſhame and her offence. By all theſe reaſons we may eaſily judge that the life of this unthankful creature, could neither be for my content nor honor. Beſides theſe, there is a principal reſpect due to my People; which is not of an inconſiderate conſequence: their importunities are for a Succeſſor, a King: they fear (if I die) that they ſhall have a Queen to reign over them: and (notwithſtanding) their ardent deſires for a Prince of <hi>Wales)</hi> I beleive they are not paſſionate to have that Prince the ſon of <hi>Anne Bullen.</hi> This is another conſideration of ſuch Importance, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take care to remove this invincible obſtacle, intending ſo much the publique felicity of the People: ſo that it is impartially neceſſary that ſhe periſh to prepare a way to the Peoples greater good, and the Kings greater glory. There is this advantage more in this deſign, that little or no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will ſurvive to revenge her death. As for thoſe who oppoſed her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they will not ranke themſelves in Arms to fight her quarrel; and ſeeing <hi>Death is accuſtomed to diſarm Beauty,</hi> that of <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> can do no more then a beam of the Sun when it is ready to ſet, ſhine a while, and be no more ſeen. In ſuch a dreſs She and her Beauty will go together to the Grave, and there be buried in oblivion and duſt. But what ſhall I ſay? I cannot but be aſſured that her Memory and Image will be much in my Fancie and Preſence, though ſhe be abſent, and interred in obſcurity. May I not then fear, leaſt I ſhould repent the Sentence, and ſorrow for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? The Policy of <hi>Herod</hi> was no leſs fortified then mine, and his heart no leſs tender; his fancie was wounded, which repreſented unto him his <hi>Mariamne,</hi> who was leſs criminal then her, of whom I have ſo juſtly complained. Notwithſtanding he repented of her death, he wept, he grieved; his Fancie was ever followed with her Image; he loſt all content and repoſe, and (at laſt) ſubmitted to wiſh, that Death had faln on him which he executed upon her. I may then juſtly fear the expoſing of my ſelf to ſuch a continued torment of my Fancy and Imagination; and not raſhly pronounce that ſentence (which executed) is irrevokable. And yet there is a great difference and diſtinction betwixt the proceedings of this Politician and my ſelf: <hi>Mariamne</hi> was not only his wife, but his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and Queen; and though he were her love and husband, yet he was her ſubject, and a Tyrant, and (conſequently) he ought to have had more regard and remorſe, and not to have acted but with greater Wiſdom, and more ſage precaution: but (on the contrary) I am a King, her Love, and a husband inraged and abuſed, by one who was my Subject, and to whom I gave a Crown: finding then my ſpirit not capable to digeſt ſo great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, I will baniſh the ſuſpicions of fear; and being a King (though a Husband) I ſhall take heed that I fall not into ſuch a baſe and ignoble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. No, no, my ſoul is now free from the irregular paſſion of Love,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96822:91"/>
and will not admit thoſe falſe deluſions to trouble my Fancy: Her crime hath deſtroyed her innocency, and her offence will more probably appear before my memory, then her Beauty ſo foulely ſtained. I ſhall look upon her (as I ought) without prejudice to Juſtice and Glory; and therefore conclude, that it is neceſſary ſhe die; yet if I ſhould deprive her of the Crown without the retrenchment of her head, and ſo render her into her firſt condition, it may be that Love which I had once for her, might plead for the continuance of her life; but as ſhe is a Crowned Queen, and Mother to my Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I cannot ſafely depoſe her from the Throne, but I muſt force her to her Tomb; and when ſhe deſcends from the one, ſhe muſt not ſtop till ſhe fall into her Grave. I doubt not but poſterity will be divided in their judgment in the examination of this Action: ſome will ſay that <hi>Henry</hi> was cruel, others that he was ſtout and generous; but after the variety of Cenſures, it is certain that <hi>Kings muſt act as Glory councels them; which ought to be far above, and out of the reach of Fear and Scandal.</hi> It appears then to all the world that it was not by a violent precipitation, which hatred might ſuggeſt that I have proceeded to this reſolution; Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie did not ſo enrage me as to have recourſe to Poiſon, or a Poniard; ſo to have diſpatched this infamous Woman by mine own hand: no, if ſhe dye, the Laws do judge her, and her own crime condemn her; and if I have contributed any thing to her fall, it is a progreſs without injuſtice or reproach; ſeeing that I was ſo paſſionate for her, as to chooſe her Miſtreſs of my Heart, there to ſerve her; and in that affection my heart command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hand to ſet a Crown upon her head. Theſe circumſtances (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) do declare and manifeſt <hi>Anne</hi> more culpable to all the World. But my firſt and laſt actions were not grounded on the ſame intentions; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Crown (which I beſtowed upon her) ſhould have made her glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious, not infamous; and ſhould have inſpired into her the apprehenſions of a Queen, and not have rendred her a perſon odious and abominable: but ſeeing I am deceived in my Conjectures, it is juſt that I be puniſhed for my error, which her beauty cauſed me to fall into. Clemency (on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) is a vertue too indulgent, and not to be uſed, unleſs Juſtice were to be extruded out of dores; and pity, in this caſe, were to diſarm and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace Royal Authority. 'Tis true, <hi>Severity is terrible, but Indulgence and an inclination to Clemency more dangerous:</hi> when a Prince is injured, and great Eſtates may be deſtroyed by either, unſeaſonably practiſed, and (as we ſee) how the moſt gentle Rivers do very great miſchief when they overflow their bounds, as well as impetuous and violent Torrents: So (in like manner) exceſſive Clemency may be as offenſive as the ſevereſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. As I am not then in this action juſtly to be accuſed of too much fondneſs, ſo, nor of too much fury: for if <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> had not changed, I had been the ſame as I was in my eſpouſals, and when I ſolemnized her Coronation with ſo much honour and joy; and if ſhe had not faln to be diſloyal, ſhe ſhould not have found her Grave ſo ſuddainly. Now as to the two Vertues, Juſtice and Clemency; the firſt moſt firmly ſupporteth the Kings Throne, and without it the Royal Authority is ſhaked to nothing in an inſtant, and ſhe is moſt eſſential to ſupport the Crown and Scepter: Clemency may be ſometimes called to the Councel, but the preſence of Juſtice is more abſolutely neceſſary. In this Act then (my Lord) admire not if I proceed as the glory and renown of a King requires, as the Laws or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; and with that reſolution which my paſſion and reaſon cannot be admitted to plead againſt. It muſt be ſo then, that this miſerable wretch
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96822:92"/>
cannot be exempted from the puniſhment ſhe hath merited; ſhe muſt not longer have any harbor in my heart, there being no perſon or Argument to intercede for her defence; her moſt deteſtable Brother hath ſhamefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his horrid crime, his companions are become his Accuſers, her own conſcience convinceth her, my great favours aggravate her reproaches, the memory of her proſperity doth torment her, the fear of her puniſhment doth cauſe her to tremble, the repreſentation of her fault (ſo ſhameleſs and unparallel'd) covers her with confuſion: what remains then, but to bring her to Execution, where ſhe may make (if poſſible) reparation to mine honour: where let the ungrateful wretch have an ignominious death, and die with ſuch diſadvantage, as to have no monument in my memory, but what ſhe has with all the World, Scorn and Hatred: let her bloud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face thoſe Characters of Love, which were ſo profoundly engraved in my ſoul, and (forgetting all her dalliances of Love and Beauty) let us ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice her and them to our Honour and Renown.</p>

                  <p>AS for this particular Action towards <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> it meeteth with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cenſures; as well of thoſe who approve, as thoſe who condemn and diſlike the Action. As to the Parallel betwixt this Prince and <hi>Herod,</hi> and ſo betwixt <hi>Mariamne</hi> and <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> it ſeems not ſo juſt and reaſonable; for <hi>Herod</hi> was not as <hi>Henry,</hi> a King by birth, but by <hi>Mariamnes</hi> means and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and as for the two Queens, <hi>Mariamne</hi> was innocent and vertuous, but <hi>Anne</hi> criminous and guilty. And therefore this violent Prince was leſs unjuſt (though ſevere) becauſe Majeſty was ſo offended. The Royal Bed ought to be kept as ſacred and inviolable as the Imperial Throne; and of the two, the firſt is to be attended with ſtricter and more vigilant Guards: as for the Scepter, it may be wreſted and forced out of the Princes hand without diſhonour; and it may be recovered again with advantage of greater renown: but the the Royal Bed once ſtained, doth not only enrage the Prince, but the People; and that injury ſpreadeth to a poiſon, which can find no Antidote: and it ſtaineth Majeſty ſo deeply, as the Spot never to be waſhed out. Therefore the Romans concluded, that it was not only neceſſary for <hi>Caeſars</hi> Queen to be chaſt and innocent, but free from Calumny and all Cenſure, and above the reach of Scandal, which is an inſeperable companion of Suſpicion. And if <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> repudiated his Queen on a bare jealouſie, how intolerable is reproach and infamous ſcandal? much more odious then, is the crime of looſneſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency; The only Spot that ſtuck on <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Succeſſor (when he was mounted far out of the reach of the cruel decrees of the Triumvirate) 'twas that he eſpouſed <hi>Livia,</hi> being ſhe was great with child, and after ſhe was divorced from <hi>Drucius Nero</hi> her husband, from thence ſprang that tart ralliarie amongſt the Romans, <hi>That all thoſe whom Fortune favours, may have ſuch ſucceſſes as to have children within three months after marriage. Tyberius</hi> his adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſon and Succeſſor to the Empire, was more ſenſible of his honour; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiated <hi>Julia, Auguſtus</hi> daughter, baniſhed her from <hi>Rome;</hi> and having branded her name with the mark of eternal infamy, condemned her to dye an exile, and there to bury her crime and ſhame. This Grand Politician well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that all <hi>injuries to Princes are intolerable,</hi> but crimes of ſuch infamy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96822:92"/>
and diſhonour, are to be puniſhed with the moſt ſeaſonable and ſevereſt revenge: and that the leaſt favor or mitigation to offences of this nature, are as impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, as odious and dangerous. There is nothing ſo much obſcureth the Sun, as when it is eclipſed by the Moon: and the diſgrace is as great as the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, when a Queen is falſe to her Lord and Soveraign. Beſides, the dangers are imminent, and conſequences very fatal. The extravagant marriage of <hi>Caligula</hi> manifeſteth this to all the world; who having eſpouſed <hi>Ceſonia,</hi> his Court was ſpeedily corrupted with great diſorders, which introduced and brought in ſhameful conſequences in the Government of the Empire: but if impudencie ever ſwelled to an exceſs and outcry, and that vice met with equal ſtupid patience to tolerate it, if not to give it countenance; it was when that immodeſt and vicious <hi>Meſſalina</hi> was the eſpouſe and wife of dull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Claudius;</hi> during whoſe reign, her deportment was as laſcivious and vile, as he was unworthy and altogether baſe. And Hiſtory only takes notice of them as horrid diſgraces to the times they lived in. And this was not all, <hi>Meſſalina</hi> dared to quit <hi>Claudius</hi> and married another, which high affront the Emperour endured: but after a long and prodigious inſenſibility, he awaked at laſt, and put <hi>Meſſalina</hi> to death; and ſo terminated her life and her diſhonour. If <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> were more uxorious and kind to his wife <hi>Fauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> (though ſhe was a moſt irregular and extravagant woman) it is to be thought that his Philoſophy was too much Stoical; and ſuch dull ſtupidity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not an Emperour, who had the Domination of the World. We may then conclude, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight did not act againſt the maxims of Policy, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or Reaſon in puniſhing this infamous offender, and if he gave occaſion to the world to blame him for his ſix marriages; and by reaſon of his outrages towards Churchmen, and great troubles in the change of Religion; yet in this lawful revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as in many other Acts of famous memory) he merits the teſtimony of honour and renown; and ſeeing that for his book againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the Pope honoured him with the glorious title of <hi>Defenſor Fidei:</hi> It is an argument that the Actions of great <hi>Kings,</hi> are not to be cenſured with raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and precipitation: for <hi>they are as ſome eminent Stars which move in ſuch a Sphere, as all the world do not perceive; and as their condition is ſeparated and tranſcendent to others, ſo theſe viſible Earthly Gods have their reaſons and reſolutions apart.</hi> Such another was that famous Prince <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who hath been cenſured and condemned, and his means and wayes reputed as unjuſt, and utterly unlawful to the Throne, and his reign an Uſurpation: but if we will liſten to the reaſons which he ſpake for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and as an Apologie for the great change of affairs; we may (perhaps) alter our judgments, and not prejudicate Princely actions. Let us then leave the diſcourſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England,</hi> and hear what <hi>Pepin</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his juſtification, who took the Crown of <hi>France</hi> from off the head of the laſt of the race of <hi>Clovis</hi> the Grand, and place that Royal Diadem on his own head.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Acclamations of the People were ſo general and loud; then, when you annointed me and gave me the Crown as a preſent from the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> of the Kingdom, that thoſe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes of joy and exulation reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> and all parts of the Earth are well ſatisfied that <hi>Childrick</hi> (being not longer able to ſupport the Royal Scepter) I was impetuouſly conſtrained to take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hands, and forced with a kind of violence, to endeavour the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that Glorious and Royal Throne; and not to ſuffer it to fall with ſhame and infamie. And yet (perhaps) many thouſands are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with thoſe Motives and Reaſons which preſſed me to thoſe high reſolutions: and it is a debate judiciouſly to be examined, Whether I was rather to accept, or refuſe the Supreme and Soveraign power of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the action not meerly reflecting upon my ſelf, but likewiſe with the effects of much good or evil on the people; and ſo conſequently, with glory or diſhonour redundant to my ſelf in thoſe mighty undertakings. In this Conjuncture, a Prince ought to be furniſhed with all advantages of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as well as of Valour and Reſolution. Thoſe who onely judge of content by the external appearance of gliſtering objects, ambitiouſly and raſhly reach at any thing that appeareth Glorious; but <hi>an Imperial Diadem is not to be accepted, but by ſuch great Heroes whoſe vertues can more illuſtrate a glorious Crown.</hi> We ſee that Infants and ignorant perſons cannot gather the bluſhing Roſes without danger of pricking their fingers with thoſe little Thorns; which like natural Guards, wait on thoſe ſcarlet flowers. As for me (whoſe Anceſtors have imployed their lives to ſupport the Throne, whereon I am ſeated) I am not ignorant how that all their endeavours were intirely devoted for the preſervation of the ſelf ſame Crown. And I cannot but confeſs, that I am obliged to be as diligent and active, and ſo moſt ſtrictly to examine my abilities in managing the high affairs of a Kingdom,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96822:93"/>
in which I ſhall not leave out any Circumſtance that may render my ſelf more capable, or the Throne more honourable. 'Tis true; I am not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who had the friendſhip and councel of <hi>Mecaenas</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to adviſe in the danger of my weighty occaſions: And yet I ſhal not fail to examine up, and ſearch into every corner of my ſoul, to preſent my condition more fit for ſo Princely an Office; and ballance all reaſons judiciouſly, which may either perſwade me to, or remove my thoughts from the acceptance of the Royal Robe; and I ſhall ſeverely ſcan all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſputes, that my judgment and reaſon may gain the greater victory: and if I have received the Crown, I doubt not but I ſhall make it appear that my Vertues have merited much, as well as my birth; and it is not an Addition to be ſleighted, that in receiving of the Diadem, I have had ſo long and ſo ſerious a conteſtation with mine own ſoul. You know well, the ſolemn dayes of Triumph are better Regiſtred, then eaſily to ſlip out of memory; and you were then my Remembrancer, that I ſhould declare my reſentment and reaſons, why I embraced the Crown; that the people as well as my ſelf, might more clearly underſtand why I became their Soveraign, and they my Subjects. To ſatisfie this great curioſity <hi>(I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) when <hi>I</hi> look upon the height of the Royal condition and quality of a King, <hi>I</hi> beheld it as thoſe who have in their view a dangerous precipice; and <hi>I</hi> did not lightly and ambitiouſly ſo much aſpire to more tranſcendent Eminencie; but likewiſe prudently conſider the varieties of dangers of ſo high a place: and when <hi>I</hi> held the Scales of both Honour and Danger in my hands, and poiſed them both together; <hi>I</hi> diſcerned ſo many troubles and cares, travels, hardſhips, wars, and ſo many ſecret diſcontents follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Royalty at her heels, that through mine own conteſtations and debates, without farther diſputes, <hi>I</hi> found it moſt rational to repulſe the motion and propoſition of the Supreme Dignitie, and beheld it as an enemy to my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate repoſe, and no friend (probably) to my future Glory. But in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reflection (the firſt notions being corrected by the latter) when <hi>I</hi> conſidered that what was propoſed, aimed at the conſervation of a mighty Monarchy, <hi>I</hi> could not but admit my reaſon to farther conſultation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving if any misfortune ſhould arrive through my faults and errors, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be only reſponſible to the great Governour of all the Univerſe; who requires from none an account, but of thoſe Talents that he beſtows upon them, and in this truſt <hi>I</hi> reſolved not to fail. <hi>I</hi> began then more cloſely and attentively to purſue thoſe great affairs; but in this Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I</hi> conſidered with my ſelf, as my Grandfather <hi>Pepin,</hi> and illuſtrious <hi>Charls</hi> my Father, conſulted with themſelves: The firſt would never be perſwaded to entertain the thoughts of Soveraigntie; and the ſecond did re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſe it with the title of King; and would not accept of it but to be ſtiled The French Prince: theſe times and ſymptoms ſeemed to preſage an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and yet there was no appearance that the Subjects were willing to change their Maſter. Beſides, for many years the Throne was not enjoyed but by Princes of more incapable and weaker judgments to reign and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern: ſo that from the reign of <hi>Dagobert</hi> the firſt, whoſe juſtice va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and pietie, were more conſiderable; the <hi>Cloviſes,</hi> the <hi>Clotairs,</hi> the <hi>Childericks,</hi> the <hi>Theodoricks,</hi> and the <hi>Childeberts,</hi> and <hi>Dagobert</hi> himſelf the ſecond, rendred the State into ſuch pitiful conditions, that if the Major of the Pallace had not been found more capable to rule and govern, it had not been, but that the Kingdom had faln oftner then once into the hands of Foreigners, Strangers, or Enemies. Notwithſtanding <hi>Pepin</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96822:94"/>
to ſerve his Maſter, and to obſcure and ſupport his infirmities. It may be there are ſome who would ſay, that this ſervice was for ſelf advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and to lay the foundations of his own Royal Family; but what could he do otherwiſe, but as a good and faithful Subject, cauſing Juſtice and Piety to flouriſh; and ſo to attribute the Renown to his Prince during his reign. But a continuation of this ſervice was impoſſible; neither would the People be ſatisfied, where the Prince was ſo dull, and ſuch errors and diſhonour in the Government. It was by my means that the Duke of <hi>Fryze</hi> (that Pagan) was vanquiſhed; and afterwards obliged to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and become <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Utrecht</hi> was re-eſtabliſh'd, whom <hi>Ebroin</hi> had chaſed from his Epiſcopal Chair; and that the <hi>Almains</hi> (on both ſides the <hi>Rhein)</hi> who levied their Forces againſt the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> were ſubdued: and what endeavours were not uſed to keep the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> from an utter deſolation; and to reſtore it to its Priſtine Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Honor. And if <hi>Pepin</hi> (in all theſe actions) did not propoſe and fancie Royaltie in the ſucceſs of ſo many atchievements; he were ingrate as well to his fortunes as to his vertues. <hi>Charls Martel</hi> was not ſo confined, who (what ever he did) conceived he merited, and expected honour both from Prince and People. And yet whilſt theſe affairs were in action the wayes and means were facile and eaſie to him to have mounted the Throne. And 'tis true that <hi>incomparable Valour accompanied with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Juſtice, Generoſitie, Clemencie, Moderation, Piety, and good Succeſs, may boldly attempt any thing:</hi> Notwithſtanding ſome may ſay, that he drove a nail into the Wheel of Fortune; and (maugre the Infirmity of <hi>Dagobert, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ilprick,</hi> and <hi>Chiderice,</hi> (under whom he ſerved) or (to ſpeak more properly) under whom he reigned) he made then a ſcruple to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and take a Scepter out of their hands, from whom God himſelf had ſeemed to ſnatch it; having given them over to their vices and irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: which introduced all vileneſs into the Kingdom, and therefore threatned a fatal deſolation. I do ſolemnly profeſs the two examples of my Grandfather and my Father had almoſt prevailed with me, to make me reſolve to die, and lay my fortune at <hi>Childricks</hi> feet, though I ſaw the Throne in an apparent ruine; and if I had not been charmed from thoſe thoughts by the importunity and univerſal ſuffrages of the people, I had certainly periſhed, and been buried under the Ruines of that Throne. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which I muſt act to my lawful Prince (though he were never ſo weak, and therefore leſs reverenced by his Subjects) did torment my thoughts, and I could not but conjecture that the end might be as miſerable, as the way and means unjuſt and injurious; and if I attempted to aſcend the Throne by the Depoſing of my lawful Prince, I ſhould not be of better reputation with the people, then an Uſurper: and it is a vulgar concluſion, <hi>He who is an Uſurper to his Maſter, cannot but be a Tyrant to his Subjects.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the people wil then cenſure that all the ſervices of <hi>Pepin</hi> my Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Charls</hi> my Father, were nothing elſe but politique Arts and means to undermine the Crown; and ſo more eaſily to derive it on their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty. Theſe thoughts allayed the heat of my ambition, and retarded that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which hurrieth moſt mens deſires in the obtaining of Soveraign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Beſides, if I aſſume the Title of King, may not thoſe hands who lift me up, pull me lower then ever I was? may they not diſpute againſt my merits and qualities as not agreeing with Princely dignity? or may they not be outragious, and charge me with ignobleneſs and ingratitude, and murmur at all rewards, as not proportionable to their demerits and ſervice? if ſo many
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96822:94"/>
admirable qualities are neceſſary for a legitimate and lawful Prince, what abilities can render a Subject fit to reign? As for thoſe who were my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals in condition and merit, though they have carried me on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and lifted me to the Crown, they cannot but ſpeedily repent, unleſs they therefore elevated me to ſo high a precipice, that my fall might be more certain, more ſuddain, and more dangerous: and who have been born and lived with me under the ſame Prince, and ſame Laws, (the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects common birth-right) how can they ſubmit that I ſhould be their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Head, who have been my ſuperiors or companions? may not ſuch an ambition ſtain the reputation of all my former ſervices with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and infidelity? and that inſtead of concealing or ſupporting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of <hi>Childrick,</hi> I intended nothing but a direct eſtabliſhment of Tyranny in <hi>Pepin.</hi> Beſides all this, will not theſe courſes give a ſpecial advantage to neighbour Princes for Invaſions, and raiſe immortal Factions with the Grandees of this Kingdom; and would not this way foment and cheriſh a foreign and a civil War? and did I not by theſe actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the whole world to an <hi>odium</hi> of me, and to deviſe conjurations againſt my life, honor, and poſterity? I am not ignorant that many Sages (mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Antiquity) have refuſed royal Crowns. And when I come to conſider my ſelf, if I receive the Scepter, I cannot but loſe the fidelity of my choiceſt friends, becauſe they are not now my equals, and of friends they muſt be rendered flatterers, and ſlaves to my Fortunes; and if I ſhall expoſe my ſelf to be ſeduced by their cunning Artifice, who inveagle and inviron Kings with their ſmooth Arguments, and ſo be corrupted to admit injuries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice: I ſhall but prepare every one whom I ſhould command, to curſe me with their Tongues, or ſtrike me with their hands. Moreover ſeeing Princes are ſubject to all errors and misfortunes in Government, I may loſe my reputation, and be branded with the vices of cruelty and violence; or elſe be accuſed and thought guilty of raſhneſs, ignorance, and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Theſe conſequences cannot but provoke great numbers of ſecret, as well as publique enemies; and ('tis oft ſeen) that <hi>diſcontents can unite all parties in the deſtruction of an object generally hated.</hi> Theſe reaſons may deter my reſolutions from the acceptance of a Crown; which high degree is too apt, not only to raiſe many enemies, but to create their rage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to be implacable: and if ſubjects interpret the greateſt bounty of their Prince but a debt or (perhaps) a reward too little to ſatisfie their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: how inſatiable will the Subjects be in their demands from ſuch a Prince, whom they have advanced from their own condition? They common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude that Kings are but the great Treaſurers of their Kingdoms, and therefore are obliged to largeneſs and bounty; and 'tis uſual that a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyal or a repulſe (in the leaſt or greateſt matter) provoketh bitter mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings or publique outrages. Nay, they conclude that Kings are obliged (by Divine Right) to give all that they poſſeſs, and as the Ocean receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her vaſt Tributes from the Inland Rivers, returneth the waters by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret paſſages, which break up in boiling Fountains and pearling Springs; ſo they argue, Princes who receive the publique Tributes of the People, are but truſted to preſerve them untill they be to be refunded and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly paid back again. In this ſimilitude it is obſervable, that although the Sea do give leave that ſome few Fountains do break up, and ſo water ſome places of the earth, yet ſhe is unthankful as to the general; and leaveth many vaſt parts, for want of moiſture, to be altogether ſteril and barren: and thus Princes, though they may oblige ſome friends and favourites

with the Dew and drops of their bounty; yet the many thouſands of the people not reliſhing of their liberality, rather become their enemies then humble and obliged Subjects. In this argument what froward appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions will poſſeſs the People, who are too reſolute to interpret a right of all things in themſelves; and that their Prince, as the Sea, is obliged to return the waters more clear and ſweet, which his vaſt power hath imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and rendred leſs pleaſant and more unwholſome. And although I have alledged ſo many reaſons for my refuſal of a Crown; yet theſe which follow, appear more of force, farther to diſſwade my Reſolutions: for as I am not a King, ſo neither am I the ſon of one; which I conceive as the greateſt obſtacle in this deſign: I know that I have ſome drops of Royal bloud ſtreaming in my veins; and (though far remote) can claim a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of kindred to <hi>Clovis</hi> the Grand: and though I may not be ſo near in bloud, yet I am not ſo remote from his vertues and merit as <hi>Childerick:</hi> which conſideration doth a little more ſuppreſs all ſcruple and niceneſs. But how can I dare to approve the acclamations of the People, in that which I fear and diſlike in my ſelf? my Ambition is to thinne a cover to diſguiſe and veil the Truth it ſelf; and my inquietude (in this conteſtation) as it is reſtleſs in my breſt, ſo it is unexpreſſible in my language; And on one ſide, I ſee a Throne ſtaggering and ready to fall; a feeble and vitious Prince, who through his Vices and weakneſs hath ſhaken the foundations of a Royall Kingdome: I ſee the People generally in Commotions, and the more Couragious already armed; and in their jealouſies and indignation. I ſaw their eyes chiefly fixed and directed towards me, and all their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons point towards my ſelf as the Center of Royalty, and they were great with expectation for a Soveraign and King, worthy of their obedience and ſo glorious a Diadem. In this Conjuncture I cannot but obſerve the Symptoms of a mighty change; and in thoſe apprehenſions, I muſt not be injurious to my own fortunes: And (on the other ſide) I feel equitable intentions towards the People in the motions of mine own ſoul, concurring with their deſires in my advance. And if in this great expectation I ſtill ſupported the Debillities of my Maſter, I was not certain whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would longer ſuffer me to ſerve under his name: which conſideration (if not prevented) as it might prove a certain ruine to <hi>Childrick;</hi> might (probably) hazard mine own Perſon, and the Kingdoms Peace. Seeing then the diſorders of his life, and his Affairs were ſo irregular, and cauſed the Grandees to grow into Factions, and the Commons to murmur; and both reſolved to quit and change their Maſter; I cannot find, but for the Kingdoms happineſs (as well as for mine own renown) to uſe my utmoſt endeavours to govern ſo great a Kingdom; and ſo to preſerve it from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. If we look upon the whole Univerſe, all Countries and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms make up but one great body, and every particular Member is obliged to aid and aſſiſt the whole. It is thus in any one Royal Kingdom; all the Subjects are unanimouſly engaged to preſerve the common good: and the Members cannot but be in confuſion, and ſick, if the Head be unſound; and if we conſider thoſe enormious vices of thoſe two Princes, to whom my Grandfather <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charls</hi> my Father did ſuch eminent ſervices; and what were the vertues of <hi>Charls</hi> and <hi>Pepin:</hi> it cannot but be confeſſed that our family hath moſt highly merited, both from King and People: and though the Deſcent, and right in bloud ought to be inviolable, and not to be interrupted; yet the vices and inability of Kings, may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their reigns, as deſolate and diſſolve their Kingdoms: and <hi>the King</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:96822:95"/>
                  <hi>of Kings who firſt advanced Princes to reign, can, when he pleaſeth ſet a period to their ſucceſſors.</hi> And as to my ſelf, I am ſo well ſatisfied with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of fortune, that as Subjects ought not to aſpire to Crowns; ſo it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with my honour not to refuſe ſuch a Dignity. The vanity may be as well in him who Stoically ſcorneth the ſplendor of Glory, as in him who ambitiouſly gapeth after it. And Hiſtory telleth us, that thoſe who did not accept <hi>Alexanders</hi> Preſents, were as deeply accuſed of Pride, as (if they had received them) they might have been taxed with Avarice. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that I am premoniſhed by the previſion of an univerſal deſolation, that <hi>I</hi> am encouraged by the popular acclamations of the Subjects, that the people deſire it, and the Kingdom is in a neceſſity and exigencie; <hi>I</hi> cannot but wreſtle with ſome conſiderable Rights, and embrace the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, which is ſo ſweet a Bait to human Ambition; and where the neceſſity is ſo abſolute, <hi>I</hi> rather reſolve (though with ſome injuſtice) to aſcend the Throne, then ſee the Kingdom periſh. And when <hi>I</hi> call to mind how this Monarchy was founded by the valour and courage of <hi>Pharamond,</hi> ſo much augmented by <hi>Meroijee,</hi> and rendred ſo formidable by <hi>Clovis</hi> the Grand; and after ſo many incomparable Princes, now ready to be ruined, and to fall into the barbarous hands of <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Pagans: I</hi> am not longer amazed at my own boldneſs, nor can <hi>I</hi> plead againſt my own ambition, if <hi>I</hi> take upon me to be the Soveraign. And if <hi>Childrick</hi> muſt loſe it, no Subject can be fitter then <hi>Pepin</hi> to wear the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> whoſe Anceſtors (as well as himſelf) have ſo ſucceſsfully ſerved their Princes, and ſo affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately gained the Peoples hearts. But <hi>I</hi> muſt yet examine, and have a ſcrutiny in the corner of mine own heart; whether <hi>I,</hi> who have been ſo faithful and good a ſubject, may not prove a Tyrannous and inſufferable King; and ſo may not be ſuſpected of injury and injuſtice to all the People, who have undermined and been ſo unworthy to my own Prince. To this <hi>I</hi> anſwer, The Prince ought to be as tranſcendent in worth above others, as he is in place and degree; and to ſtrip himſelf of all predominant paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to love the Peoples good above his own; to do nothing injuſt, and not ſo much as to deſire his own renown, but by the noble aſcents of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: Kings ought to take pains and travail to make their Subjects repoſe more ſecure and ſweet, to undertake the dangers of War; but with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but better to eſtabliſh and ſettle a peace; and to imploy that peace, not in Riot and Luxury; but for a more exact courſe of Equity and Juſtice; and thereby to cauſe the kingdom to flouriſh, and vertues to ſhine and be triumphant. Likewiſe it is the office of Kings to try before they truſt, leaſt flatterers creep into great imployments, and indanger the Ruine of Prince and People; their power muſt not countenance them to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; nor their Plenty to be too indulgent, ſecure, and too much inclined to clemencie. The deſires of a Throne ought to be principally for the Peoples good, and with no other deſign, but for the Princes honour and renown; which as the Sun, ſhould ſend light and heat communicatively over all his Domination. And he who is inveſted with Majeſty, ought to have none but clear and innocent intentions, and a ſoul, not by aſſed with ſiniſter and ignoble ends; but with honourable inclinations to chaſtiſe the wicked, and to prefer and recompence vertuous and meritorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For he whoſe Soveraignty ſets him above the Laws, ought to have a ſoul more ſublime and ſpiritual, then to be tainted with the groſs Lees and feculencie of low and baſe things, as having wiſdom and courage to confirm thoſe bonds of humane Society, and ſo not to fear or violate
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96822:96"/>
thoſe rules of peace &amp; juſtice, which his own power hath formed or ſubmitted unto. And as the Prince is to live above the reach of envy and fear, ſo is he not to proſtitute his royal condition to Sycophants and flatterers, who are a kind of poyſonous flyes, which will cauſe the ſweeteſt odours and ointments quickly to ſtink; and if I now diſcerne (as being near the Throne) the breath of ſo much ſubtile poyſon; what Arts and Craft will not be undertaken to deceive and delude, with golden language of Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diſſimulation, when I have the royal Scepter in my hand? As to this inſtant, I never met with any perſon, who dared to ſay to me; <hi>Accept not of the Crown.</hi> And if all perſons have bin ſo compliant before my advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Throne, how officious and obſequious will they appear, when I have the Scepter in my hands?</p>
               <p>In the debate of theſe affairs, I meet with many invincible objections to diſſwade and diſcourage my reſolutions; but fortune and my owne ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have put wings to my expectations, and kindled ſuch a fire in my heart, as I cannot extinguiſh; and therefore I reſolve to hazard my life, honour, and repoſe and abandoning fear, and ſuſpition of dangers or diſhonour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to accept the Crown, and wear the royal Robes; ſo to commend my ſelf and ſucceſſes to the favours of fortune: Thoſe who are in the peril of naufrage, and to be ſhipwrackt in theſe tempeſtuous times, will be well pleas'd if by working at the helm, I preſerve them from periſhing in the angry waves: and if I be not ſo happy as to deliver them from danger, they will honour me for my adventures and endeavours. And if it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and fall out, that my reign be more proſperous, then the irregular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Childerick,</hi> I ſhall be eſteemed more innocent as well as more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned; and thoſe who have been my equals, will more contentedly become my humble and loyal Subjects; as for Competitours and Rivals in my fortune (if any) as I am able to ſtep a degree before them, ſo I ſhall be more enabled (in that quality) to curb their inſolency, or chaſtiſe their diſcontents: though the action be not juſtifiable, yet ſucceſsful events may render it noble and honourable in the reputation of the world; and if the poſterity of <hi>Pepin</hi> degenerate, grow effeminate, fooliſh and baſe, yet <hi>Pepin</hi> will be commended for his high attempts; and the weakneſs and miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Childerick</hi> and his Anceſtors, will be a ſtep to mount <hi>Pepin's</hi> honour to a higher eſtimation in all the Univerſe. It is true, I ſee not ſuch Princely indowments in <hi>Charles</hi> my ſon, as to merit to wear a Crown, (though his natural parts are tolerable) and it will prove a greater task for <hi>Charles</hi> to follow <hi>Pepin,</hi> then for <hi>Pepin</hi> to follow <hi>Childerick;</hi> but who knows whether <hi>Pepin</hi> may not ſo deeply plant the foundations of reſpect in his ſubjects hearts, as not onely to reign himſelf, but to make fair way for <hi>Charles</hi> to be his ſucceſſour; and if he improve not himſelf by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and merits, nor cannot winn their ſuffrages; it is not inglorious for <hi>Pepin</hi> to be a King, though his ſon ſucceed him not: and yet I doubt not but to be able to remove that difficulty; for when I find my ſelf to grow old or indiſpoſed, I ſhall ſurrender the Crown to <hi>Charles,</hi> and his poſſeſſion of ſo royal a fortune will (probably) raiſe him ſtrength and forces to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Soveraingty; and when I am not fit to march in the field, I ſhall become his Councellor for the better conduct of his great affairs; and now if by depoſing an unworthy and luxurious Prince, I be ranked amongſt the uſurpers of Crowns, the diſhonour is the leſs, becauſe the Kingdome required an alteration, and I cannot but reign with more ſecurity and leſs hatred. And if I have aſcended by an uſurpation, yet it was effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <p>How ſtrong ſoever the Arguments, and reaſons of <hi>Pepin</hi> may appear, yet the effects of his intentions will prove better warrants for his actions, then his alegations &amp; diſcourſe for to get a Crown, to which none ought to dare to aſpire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he who is a man after Gods own heart; as it was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, in depoſing of wicked <hi>Saul</hi> The Priviledges of a royal birth are attended with ſomany difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that who ſoever overcomes them cannot but be more then an extraordinary perſon. Tis true, the people are mutable and given to change, and voluntarily to ſeek new Maſters, their judgement is not ſo profound, as to foreſee what they uſually loſe by thoſe alterations; a capricious angry wantonneſs quickly armeth them againſt their ancient Kings, but commonly they fight for others and not for themſelves; and under the pretence of gaining greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, like Flyes in the Spiders web, are more intangled: and as for Princes, who have ſurreptitiouſly gained the Crown of others, it is impoſsible but that they muſt have as great dangers in the injoyment of them, as they had difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in aſcending to them; for a Royal Scepter is onely ſupported by his hand, <hi>who meaſureth the earth, and weigheth the mountains in the Scales,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe Providence a certain ruine is inevitable. New Princes cannot but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige new ſubjects, whether they are of the civil or martial garbe and order; the Souldiers are neceſſary to watch and guard to keep out fear and dangers; and their humours are generally very inſolent, and not ſatisfied with common rewards, and therefore will be apt to murmur and grow mutinous; the civil part of the people will cry out as oppreſſed with new taxations, which are the neceſſary conſequences of war, and therefore will incline to be ſeditious. Thus new dominations bring along with them the traine of miſerable and provocative effects.

where his ſuſpitions are ſo many, and his obligations ſo great. Subjects are apt to frown and murmur to ſee him who was once their equal, ſo highly elevated above them; and (although ſuperiority have been the commencement of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies long ſince, and are of a Divine foundation) yet to interrupt or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a roy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Royal Throne is ſo far above the fortune of a private perſon, that he who admitteth that ambitious indiſcreet deſigne to be predominant in his ſoul, doth but gripe at Thrones, walk on a precipice, ſtrives againſt the ſtream; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſail with the breath of fortune, and more violently for the preſent, yet his obſtacles are ſo many and ſo certain, that the foundations of a Crown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>Hercules</hi> labours, and under whoſe weight the greateſt <hi>Hero</hi> is apt to lye down, and to be ground to powder. <hi>Atilla,</hi> who was ſtiled the <hi>Rod of God,</hi> as bad he was, may teach us that all Power comes from God, and that it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth no longer then he pleaſeth. The <hi>Aſſyrians, Perſians, Greeks, Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> have reigned, and their viciſsitudes inſtruct us, that he who never changeth, cauſeth an alteration of all things elſe according to his pleaſure; and theſe great mutations arive for reaſons unrevealed to us, and that God alone foreſeeth all things who is inviſible; let us then adore, on ſuch occaſions, whom we cannot comprehend: and ſeeing that we guide not the Helm of the great veſſel of providence, let us adore and honour him who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all things: It is he <hi>who putteth the mighty from their ſeat, and exalteth the humble and meek.</hi> Thus alterations ſucceed in Empires and Kingdomes; and we may conclude that greater bodies (when God is pleaſed to permit it) have their revolutions and changes, as well as the leaſt and ſmalleſt Creatures.

You might juſtly demand from me, what reaſons perſwaded me to impriſon <hi>Bajazet</hi> within an iron Cage; and (at that time) to be ſo gentle to his ſons, as not to inchain nor confine them, but to give them their Liberty, and treat an Emperor as a common Slave; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I ſo frankly remitted all thoſe Priſoners and Slaves which I took at <hi>Caramania.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>(Axalla)</hi> you have been my General, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and my Friend; yet you have not ſo deeply ſounded and fathomed the bottom of my heart, as to prie into the ſecrets of all my Councels and Reſolves: and therefore your admiration may be the greater, not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe and reaſons of ſuch contrarieties, which (upon ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) forced me to ſuch extremities, and either to be v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I anſwer, I have not (in this occaſion) acted with Capricious levitie, nor malicious cruelty: as for my clemencie and ſeveritie, they are not certain rules of my prudence and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie; I regard neither hatred nor pity to my actions; Reaſon alone is my guide, which teacheth me to give puniſhment, pardon, or promotion, as I ſhall judge fit. And Reaſon alone which cauſed me to chain and impriſon <hi>Bajazet,</hi> directed me to ſet the Priſoners and Slaves at Liberty. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will ſay thoſe that are born in a Country where there is little lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are leſs civil, and have not much veneration any where, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie is but rude and ſavage; which though it inviteth them to approve their own actions, and that which their paſſion doth inſpire: but ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings reliſh neither of honour nor equity. I muſt confeſs <hi>(Axalla)</hi> that part of <hi>Europe</hi> (where you were bred) hath a great advantage for education in relation to thoſe colder Climates; for <hi>Genoa</hi> is in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> is (at this day) what <hi>Greece</hi> was in ancient times, the Mother of Sciences, and Fountain of Learning: yet it is true, that I am not altogether ignorant of the <hi>Royal Science</hi> which teacheth Princes to reign with Juſtice, or to puniſh without Cruelty, and to pardon without weakneſs and fear; and ſo to act the one or the other, as it ſhall tend more to mine advantage, or mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <hi>Policie</hi> (without doubt) is a thing which <hi>may be learned from books,</hi> but <hi>Experience is a more certain Miſtreſs, and teacheth her Schollers more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</hi> Now to perſwade you to believe what I ſay, as a matter not falling out by meer chance, but by ſerious and laborious ſtudies; I muſt put you in mind that this inſolent and proud Prince <hi>Bajazet,</hi> was ſometimes called the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> by a tart Ralliarie; becauſe of thoſe abundant of flocks of ſheep which he fed in his Country, a condition not agreeing with the royalty of his birth. Yes <hi>(Axalla)</hi> you cannot but remember, how at the age of fifteen, the King of <hi>Sachatay</hi> my Father, gave me a Kingdom to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; and when I was but ſixteen, I undertoke the management of the Wars againſt the Muſcovites; who when they were ranged in Battalia, were forced to yeild, and I ſlew no leſs then forty thouſand of mine enemies: and that memorable day reduced them to be my tributaries. After that, you know how the grave <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> mine Uncle, cauſed me to eſpouſe his daughter, and thought me not unworthy to be his Succeſſor: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in my abſence ambitious <hi>Calix</hi> aſpired to the Empire; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me (to be at ſuch a diſtance) leavied Arms, and drew into his parties the people of <hi>Catay;</hi> but after this injury, I had the good fortune to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh this enemy, and take him Priſoner; and in concluſion, reſolving that his crimes ſhould not be unrevenged, I drenched his rebellion in his bloud, and cauſed him to loſe his head, thus to fix more ſecurely the Crown upon mine own: and I reſolved then not to pardon, leſt I ſhould have loſt my ſelf. <hi>(Axalla)</hi> you are not ignorant when I waged War againſt the King of <hi>China,</hi> how at laſt I made my ſelf Maſter of that long and prodigious Wall, which the <hi>Chinaiſts</hi> had erected to ſeparate themſelvs inſocially from the <hi>Tartars:</hi> how I forced the Towns of <hi>Paquinfow,</hi> of <hi>Paquinohu,</hi> of <hi>Teau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenoy,</hi> and of <hi>Pannihu;</hi> and that I gave him three great battails and loſt none. In the laſt battail I made him my Priſoner, and in this ſucceſs find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the practice of generoſity would not be dangerous; I made a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of my Clemencie, and reſtored to him his Kingdom, and his Liberty; contenting my ſelf with a moderate tribute, as a teſtimony and memory to my victories. Since this effect (moſt generous <hi>Axalla,</hi> whom I equally honour as my ſelf) you know that it was through your prayers and

Beſides all this, you remember how I revenged my ſelf on the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who aſſiſted <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving almoſt intirely conquered the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, how I took in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, Damietta, Alexandria, Grand Caire,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable places of his Eſtate; and having been victorious in two Royal Battails, I forced him and his ſcattered Troops to flye, reſolving to give him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Truce nor Peace, nor a Ceſſation of Arms: you cannot likewiſe but remember that <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> and a part of <hi>Affrica,</hi> having voluntarily ſubmitted to me as I marched, how I treated them with all ſweetneſs poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and how the Perſians reſiſting, I combated with them, beat, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them; and having conquered the inſolent numbers of that Grand Empire, I ſubjugated to my power all the <hi>Glanture,</hi> and all the <hi>Tampeſtan;</hi> and having maſtered the great Town of <hi>Tauris,</hi> I placed you my Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General there, as my Vice Roy in thoſe parts; (and to your greater aſtoniſhment yet) paſſing by the <hi>Ardevel,</hi> on my return to <hi>Semarcant</hi> with an infinite number of Slaves of <hi>Caramania,</hi> and of all the vicine Nations; you cannot but recal to your thoughts how that <hi>Cheqſapy,</hi> a perſon of great vertue (whom I honoured with a viſit) begging liberty for all his Slaves, I accorded without repugnancie, conſenting with much joy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it juſt not to refuſe his requeſt, who was ſo noble to ask ſo much for others, and ſo little or nothing for himſelf. After all this experience of War, Conqueſt, and Succeſs; you cannot (faithful <hi>Axalla)</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that I have gained the Art and Science how to reign and rule; and that my reaſons are valid and ſtrong for the variety of my different Conduct in ſuch great Affairs; and if I have pardoned humble Slaves, and puniſhed a moſt ſuperb and inſolent Emperour, I have learned this way of Policie in the head of my Army, and from the impetuoſity of mine enemies, that <hi>it is moſt proper for Majeſtie to humble the proud, and pardon the ſubmiſs.</hi> This practice is not only neceſſary in the times of War, but in the times of Peace; a Rule to be obſerved at all times and all places. Lawful Princes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96822:100"/>
ought to regard this qualification; and as for Uſurpers, they cannot reign without it, this being a means to ſtop the rage of Civil Wars, and more promptly to conclude foreign Invaſions. By this way Juſtice will flouriſh and reſiſt a greater inundation of popular vices; and this will make Kings as well feared as loved. Yes (noble <hi>Axalla)</hi> the juſt mixture of ſweetneſs and ſeverity is the ſecret, which renders Royalty more formidable and leſs hateful: for <hi>a Prince who alwayes is inexorable, imprinteth nothing but fear and terror into his Subjects:</hi> and <hi>he who is too meek and mild, doth with pardons and familiarity more eaſily provoke diſloyalty and diſobedience.</hi> Wherefore a prudent Prince with theſe two qualities, will keep the world in ſuſpenſe, and make them alwayes ſerve his preſent purpoſe, without raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falling into either extremity. It is not fit that any perſon who is proud ſhould not be corrected by the chaſtiſements of Royal Power; and thoſe who are penitent and cordially humbled, ſhould not be cheriſhed with the hopes of a gracious remiſſion. In this caſe Kings ought to imitate Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, which paſs by humble ſhrubs, but ſhatter audacious and proud Oaks, whoſe high tops aſpire to touch the Clouds. The Lion could not have merited that glorious quality as to be ſtiled the King of Beaſts, but becauſe he exerciſeth his fury againſt the moſt inſolent creatures: he ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner paſſes by the feeble and gentle Lamb, then the force and fierceneſs of Buls, and the rage of Tygers. Thoſe Princes who would conſerve their Eſtates in better ſecurity, cannot find a more certain way then by their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection towards the Grandees of their Kingdom, and to ſee that they approach not ſo near to the Throne, as to have but one ſtep more to aſcend, and ſo to mount to Majeſtie. A wiſe King will alwayes keep as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between him and his Lords, as they are to make between them and the people, if they intend to preſerve their honour: if the Prince intend a ſuper-elevation to any of his Subjects, his fore-ſight of their humility ought to be the firſt ſtep to their advancement; or if they be too ſuperb and haughty, their pride is to be puniſhed with ſeverity and vindicative ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that their diſgrace might teach them more humble obedience. Now if this Maxim be neceſſary for a Prince, who is contented with the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Anceſtors, and there to govern his Subjects in Tranquility; it is much more important to him who deſires to enlarge his Territories, and is ambitious to add Victories, Triumphs, and Conqueſts to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of his Anceſtors. For if a Prince in Battalia kill the General, he is in great poſſibilitie to be Conquerour; and it arrives very rarely that fortune admitteth theſe to triumph, whoſe General and Head ſhe hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be taken away: Thus if a Prince aſſault the Capital City of a Kingdom, and chance to become Maſter; all inferiour Towns (probably) render themſelves with greater facility. It is then moſt certainly true, that it tendeth to greateſt advantage to encounter with objects of greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. When an Army marcheth through an Enemies Country, It ſtayes not before every Town and Village of leſs importance, but rather advanceth to ſuch a place that may be worthy, or recompence a ſiege: and when the taking in of one Town may be an occaſion to reduce an hundred. That which I ſaid before of War and Juſtice in general, I may now ſay of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Princes in particular: it is from the head, the higheſt and moſt noble part whereon the fortune, felicity, and glory of Kings depends. It may be if I had not taken off the head of <hi>Calix</hi> ſeaſonably, who inſolently revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me; that ſole Traitor might have proved an invincible obſtacle to my deſigns. It might have fallen out then, that I might not have been
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96822:100"/>
King of <hi>Sachetay,</hi> nor have commanded the Tarters, nor have defeated <hi>Bazajet;</hi> I might poſſibly not have vanquiſhed ſo great a part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor ſo mightily have ſubdued <hi>Perſia;</hi> and if I had not been ſucceſsful in the Protection of the Grecian Emperor (perhaps) I might have been a vaſſall to him whom I have confined to his Chaines. Do not admire then (brave <hi>Axalla)</hi> if I do not pardon the inſolency of <hi>Bajazet;</hi> my ſeverity in this grand example, cannot but make my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt more glorious and renowned: you know that this Prince was not onely in the view of all the earth, but likewiſe in his Reign was the terrour of all the univerſe; what a noiſe then ſhall his chaines make to all the world? what ſecurity and advantage may not all men hope to themſelves, by the impriſonment of this horrid Monſter? Thoſe whom he ſo ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under his tirumphant and victorious Banners, will accompt themſelves eternally obliged to me, that I have chaſtiſed their enemy and taken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on him, from whom they had received ſo many evils: thoſe who are yet mine enemies, will ceaſe to be ſevere in their deſignes againſt me, leaſt they draw that upon their owne heads, which <hi>Bajazet</hi> contracted on his, by his unparalleled cruelties: To conclude, I am well aſſured, if I ſhould admit the ſuffrages of all men into deliberation with me, I ſhould finde that none would plead for his eaſe or a relaxation, but rather an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of his ſhame and puniſhment, and to diſpatch away his life with the moſt exquiſite tortures. (Beſides) in the abaſing of the proud, two conſiderable effects ſucceed; the one in cauſing a ſmal number of criminous perſons to ſuffer, proveth the means to preſerve infinite multitudes; who either ceaſe to be malicious, or prevent themſelves to be offenders. A ſecond advantage is, that <hi>in the remiſsion of an injury, to thoſe who humbly repent, much glory is gained without any danger:</hi> for as in the multitudes of men, greater numbers are more fearful then hardy and audacious; ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand mouths will be quickly open to praiſe the clemency of the Prince; when perhaps one or ſome few malicious diſcontents, will murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine againſt his ſeverity: to give you an example, theſe great numbers of ſlaves, whom I have ſet at liberty, and who are now on their return to their ſeveral Provinces, are gone to gain me the hearts of their fellow Citizens, and ſo to eſtabliſh my conqueſts by their promulgations of my celmency; where (on the contrary) <hi>Bajazet</hi> alone, being more unfortunate, will ſcarce have any companion to joyn with him in complaints: thus conſequently, I have not acted againſt reaſon, when I commanded the Priſon gates to be ſet wide open for the Slaves of <hi>Caramania;</hi> and (at the ſame time) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſtronger Bars of Iron to confine and Cage up <hi>Bajazet:</hi> the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a revolted ſubject is ever inſupportable, the ſame is as equally difficult in a proud enemy, who hath his arms in his hand; but if that inſolency be exorbitant in a vanquiſht enemy, he deſerveth the higheſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; if it be not permitted for one in Triumph to vapor and inſult over thoſe, whom he hath ſurmounted; how intollerable then think you is the violent precoſity of a Priſoner of warr, who holds his life from him who hath made him his Captive, which he can take away at his pleaſure. No, no, <hi>(Axalla) conſtancy of courage, and inſolency of pride are not the ſame things;</hi> It may well become priſoners of warr, to carry their Irons with nobleneſs of mind, and not to loſe their hearts, though they have loſt the victory: Martial diſcipline never permitted a leſſening of that reſpect, which the Captive oweth the Conquerour, and to retort upon him with reproach and injury is a higher crime; a Conquerour may juſtly reflect upon himſelf
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96822:101"/>
ſeated in the Chair of Majeſty and Tryumph, whilſt Captives and Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are to follow the royal Train with humble looks, and misfortunate Comportments: ſo that it is not allowed for any Captive (though never ſo great) to act as did inſolent <hi>Bajazet;</hi> whoſe Pride was as vainly eleva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, as his fortune miſerably abaſed. The <hi>King of China,</hi> whom I read mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Crown and Kingdome, acted nothing (after his misfortunes) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his royal condition: as he was not baſe, he was not proud and inſolent; when he treated with <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> he ſpake with boldneſs and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, yet not fiercely, or impudently without reſpect, he did nothing unlike a King, nor any thing that exceeded the fortune of his preſent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; therefore I had reaſon to treat him otherwiſe then <hi>Bajazet:</hi> and I am to be more honoured, if I have been indulgent to the one, and not to the other. What do you think, would not this Tyger have attempted in his rage, if he ſhould have been looſed from his Chains? he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt have adventured to have torn him in pieces who gave him his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (if he had power) and railing equally againſt all men (would, if he were able) become the publick Enemy of the Univerſe: He would tell the world his Subjects had betrayed him, that his Souldiers had forſaken him, that his Enemies had evilly treated him: thus reſuming his Scepter in rage and malice, he would have deſigned a deſolation to all the earth, or (at leaſt) would have ſought the means. (No, no, <hi>Axalla)</hi> he who will not be a good Prince (ſhall being a Captive) whether he will or no, become a real Slave, without hopes to return to a Throne of Majeſty: of which cruelty hath rendered him unworthy, and made him more fit to carry Chains and Irons. Clemency, on this occaſion, might introduce too many dangers, and the intereſt of ſo many people concern'd, is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately to be paſſed over. Severity to <hi>Bajazet</hi> is more neceſſary then royal Civility, to make <hi>Bazajet</hi> to ſee the uglineſs of his owne vices (and if poſſible) to cauſe an alteration in his ſavage humors. Beſides, who may not expect Pardon, if <hi>Bajazet</hi> ſhould eſcape with any grace or lenity; he who is the curſe and execration of all the world (and who, though van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed) ſpeaks and acts ſuch things as are able to enflame the moſt calm and gentle ſoul with rage and fury. As for the ſlaves <hi>I</hi> pardoned, they were not capital, but ſubordinate enemies, ingaged in a party who were againſt me; perhaps thoſe men in their private condition quietly diſpoſed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and incapable voluntarily to offend; and conſequently ſuch perſons were proper objects for a Princes Clemency: ſuch an action as this carries along with it the preſence of ſplendour and honour; nay there is a kind of equity which pleadeth pardon for thoſe who humbly begg for Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and policy is not againſt the proceedings, if it foreſee not peril and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the conſequence. The true bounds which are to be given to clemency or ſeverity, are to be meaſured and examined by the rule of juſtice; and ſhe is to be obſerved how far ſhe ſuffers the one or the other to appear: ſome crimes are ſo horrid, as juſtice will not allow them to paſs unpuniſhed; as ſhe will not admit vertues to be deprived of their reward and recompence. Now in this conſideration, we ought to judge whether Clemency may be of more diſadvantage, or ſeverity more ſerviceable; ſo diſcerning whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imploy and exerciſe the one or the other, thus guided to undertake nothing but for the publick intereſt or ſoveraign glory. The chiefeſt mark and note of majeſty is, the loyal ſubmiſſion of ſubjects, and the higheſt mark of victory is, the humble proſtration of the vanquiſhed, who do not onely caſt downe their arms, but their lives and liberties at the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96822:101"/>
feet; whereas on the contrary, thoſe who oppoſe the divine Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Princes in their Soveraignty, are born up with the exceſs of Pride and Arrogancie: and that provocation is more intolerable which ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the inſolencie of a Captive, then from the defiance of an enemy. Be not then longer aſtoniſhed <hi>(Axalla)</hi> if you have obſerved me, ſometimes ſo gracious, and at other times ſo ſevere; but be perſwaded that I have ever been guided by the hand of Reaſon, I have pardoned where I could, and not prejudiced the advancement of my Conqueſts; I have been inflexible, and not to be moved, when I foreſaw that my Clemencie might not only prove unjuſt, but dangerous; either as to the peoples good, or to my own deſigns. It is an obſervation in Nature, that ſhe oppoſeth thoſe things that do reſiſt her, and gently yeilds to thoſe things which courteouſly offer place; ſo then from the ſimple motions of nature we cannot but accord to that which is here aſſerted. Join then with me <hi>(Axalla</hi> in this Concluſion, and ſay, That whoever conſidereth the perſon of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> that then cruelty her ſelf ceaſed to be cruelty; and that it is true that his humour was inſupportable, bloudy, inſolent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and therefore merited leaſt compaſſion; it was then a judicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to detain him within bars of iron, whom reaſon could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade nor be predominant with. To theſe reſolutions, let us perpetuate a continuation, ſo not think it irrational to pardon chearfully thoſe who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit to our power, and to puniſh with ſeverity thoſe whom neither misfortunes, nor captivity can reduce to a ſubmiſſion. Let not our pardons be granted out of fear and feebleneſs, and let not our chaſtiſements be provoked through preoccupation and hatred. Thus to wind up the clew of this diſcourſe, let us reſolve neither to pardon nor puniſh, but when reaſon ſhall conduct us for the ends of the peoples greater good, or the Princes more illuſtrious renown.</p>

Now to ſatisfie the world that I act not without reaſon, I muſt let you know that Royalty (which is the firſt and <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> in an Eſtate or Kingdom) ought to be fortified and coroborated with ſome vicine and near aſſiſtance; into which the Prince may infuſe and impart his pleaſure and power: and that effected, there may ſucceed an activity and influence to cauſe a communication to all inferior and ſubordinate orbs and motions to facilitate the Government of greater affairs. An eminent perſon or Prince of quality nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the condition of his Soveraign, is ſo neceſſary, as without the Councels and aſſiſtance of a chief Miniſter of State it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to enjoy or ſee a proſperous Reign in the Negotiations of ſo great a kingdom. The glorious body of the bright Sun cannot (at the ſame inſtant) communicate his beams, and be radiant to all cantons and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth; and if the Sun did not participate his lumination to the inferior Stars, the Semicircle and Moiety of the World would ever be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in obſcuritie and darkneſs. Thus it is not poſſible for a Prince to Regulate and honourably Govern his Eſtate without a communication of his power, being as the Sun, to radiate and ſhine over all the parts of his Kingdom at the ſame time. And as it is with <hi>God,</hi> ſo it is with Princes, who bear his Image; the Divine power doth operate by ſecond and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate cauſes in the Government of the Univerſe; where ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent concurrences do meet, and a Kingdom (being a vaſt Body) where ſo many varieties of diſſenting affairs do convene. A Prince cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually operate in them all without a participation of his truſt and power to ſome noble and faithful aſſiſtant. Beſides, a Prince is to the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique and Kingdom, what the Soul is in the Body Natural; and the chief Miniſter of State, is to be as the moſt noble, chiefeſt part and organ to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey his Princes royal pleaſure with more eaſe and honour into all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior parts and members. Thus whoſoever obſerves accurately, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders judiciouſly the office and obligations of ſupreme Power, muſt rationally conclude, that Kings are not only above their ſubjects in honor and dignity, but in their pains and cares: not only conducting their affairs, but protecting their perſons, directing their people how to enrich themſelvs; governing and guarding their lives and fortunes from foreign as wel as from unnatural and civil wars. It belongeth to the Princes care to pardon as well as to puniſh; to ſee that Piety and Peace may proſper, and that Juſtice flouriſh. The leaſt of theſe duties is (almoſt) a burden too inſupportable for the ſhoulders of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, (though never ſo wel qualified.) Therfore for a more happy tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, publick welfare and repoſe, ſuch a creature is abſolutely neceſſary, in whoſe perſon his Prince may confide; who transferring a great ſhare of weighty affairs to his tranſaction and abilities, the Prince may rule with more honour, and the people enjoy more publique advantages. But as a chief Miniſter may be ſerviceable to the State, ſo it infinitely concerneth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96822:103"/>
the Prince to be diſcreet and moſt judicious in his choice: the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſageſt of the Subjects beſt meriteth to be elevated and called to his Royal Dignity and Truſt. For it is certain the Prince very plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſageth the ſucceſs and proſperity of his affairs and Government, by his election and choice of his chief Councellor and Miniſter of State: who, if of greater worth, vertue, and illuſtrious qualities, doth more dignifie his Maſter, and better gratifie and content his Subjects. But this care is ever to be uſed, that the Prince preſerve his diſtance, leſt his Miniſters grow too inſolent, which might endanger to leſſen the ſplendor of Majeſty, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion injury and injuſtice towards the people. 'Twas for this reaſon why I reſolved to remove and diſcharge the Office of the Major of the Pallace, who (commonly) ſo much entrenched and encroached on the Priviledges belonging to Royalty. Now in the creation of this Order of a Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>France,</hi> I intend nothing elſe but an Office of Conveniencie; which may prove of great uſe to the Prince and to the Kingdom: and if the Major of the Pallace had lived under Princes, who had been able to rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the high priviledges of Soveraignty, that Office might (to this day) have been more toierable; but the Princes infirmities having given way to them to grow inſolent, and too much to uſurp on Majeſty, their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and a conſtitution of a new Order of Conſtable is more proper and agreeable; which place is not inalterable, his Beeing depending on his Princes pleaſure. Yet <hi>it is ſound Policie rather not to elevate to high places, then after a Commiſsion ſealed for truſt and honour, to diſgrace and remove.</hi> Wherefore the Prince is not to chooſe his prime Miniſter of State in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of paſſion, or according to the common deluſions of popular vogues and ſuffrages: but after a ſerious conſultation with his own Reaſon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt glanced at the commendations and advice of his beſt and ableſt Councellors. It is true, thoſe who by eminency of their birth are born near to the Throne, being of Royal alliance and bloud, having their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation proportioned accordingly to render them more illuſtrious and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may expect before others (who are not their Peers, neither in worth or birth) the honour of this high priviledge: but if their vertues be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their birth, equity is bound to plead for their dignities and merits. Such a condition is more preferrable, becauſe their perſons and eſtates are ſo nearly twiſted in the intereſt of the Crown, that they muſt neceſſarily flouriſh with it, or elſe fall, and ſo be buried under the ſame misfortunate and fatal Ruines. And (to confeſs truth impartially) it were a kind of injury, where birth and worth meet, that ſuch perſons ſhould not be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the greateſt Truſt, the chiefeſt Honour, and higheſt qualities; nay, to exclude ſuch illuſtrious Capacities, were not only a diſcouragement to their Noble Perſons, but to Vertue and Majeſty it ſelf, which requireth the ſervice and attendance of the greateſt magnificence. Yet this great concernment ought to be of ſuch importance and care that the Prince take notice, how it is more abſolutely neceſſary that the perſon honour more his place and office with his vertues and abilities, then his place honour him. Therefore an impartial judicious choice is moſt chiefly to be uſed; and if thoſe of more noble birth and extraction (degenerating from the vertues of their Anceſtors, and utterly void of their great abilities) are incapable, and merit not ſo near a relation to Soveraignty: the Prince may make his choice where a more vertuous ability and a more noble capacity primely appeareth amongſt others of his Subjects. For as the King hath his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to chooſe at his pleaſure amongſt ſo many thouſands of his people;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96822:104"/>
ſo each one of them, who is ingenious and vertuous is capable of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Election and favour. Now as for the perſons whom the Prince advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to ſo high imployment, they are as Rivers whoſe Channels are deep and profound, whoſe Banks are diſtanced and large, to that end that the fierce Torrents, falling and ſtreaming down, they may not cauſe an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and ſo a deſtruction and ſterility; but gently watering the fields, may cauſe them to be more fruitful and luxuriant: for it is moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious if great Rivers ſwell and make their banks and borders full, all the exceſs in the Current is to fructifie the Country where the ſtream runs, then (at laſt) to empty it ſelf with greater fulneſs into the vaſt and mighty Ocean. Thus the chief Miniſter is like a pleaſant ſtream to enrich the State, and in the end, to flow more abundantly with advantages and proſperous returns to Majeſty. Yet if it ſo fall out that the Prince be ſo unfortunate in his choice, that he whom he imployeth be not of a fit capacity, he may juſtly fear thoſe diſaſters in Government, which are ordinary in the courſe of Nature; and that confuſion in the State, which an inundation cauſeth in the Country when the Banks are broken down; where, if the breaches cannot ſpeedily be repaired, an inevitable danger may ſucceed to the whole Kingdom. On the contrary, if the chief Councellour be fortunate in his conduct of affairs, and that this imployment falleth into the hands of an Heroick and Noble ſoul; a perſon in whom prudence and all the vertues eminently appear, and who hath gained the true Maxims of Policie by a long experience, and whoſe ambition is inflamed entirely for his Maſters ſervice and the peoples welfare; in ſuch a condition the Prince may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his own and of his peoples ſafety. Then heaping honours upon his Creature, he may daily communicate to him greater power. In effect, if celeſtial providence had not removed from the Throne the latter Kings, who were leg itimate in their birth; but unworthy to deſcend from <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> by their ignoble qualities, I might yet have been there ſubject: and what authority ſoever, and charge, to be Major of the Pallace, and to be <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Paris, Prince</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> together with the merits of <hi>Hugh Le Grand</hi> my Father gave me, I ſhould never have adventured to aſcend the Throne if the right heir to the crown had not deſcended thence, and if <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> had not by his actions renounced that right to which he might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. All theſe Circumſtances accompanied with the univerſal ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the people and puiſſant Soveraignty united, hath invited me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what I could not honourably refuſe and reſiſt. Let not Princes fear then to impart and communicate their Authority, but when it is evident, and they apprehend it may tend to their diſhonour and diſadvantage. <hi>Princes are ſubject to errour as well as other men, and therefore not without their fears and jealouſies.</hi> Now it is impoſſible but that a Prince conferring his truſt into the hands of ſuch eminent perſons; their cheifeſt buſineſs will be to reſpect their Maſters, to obſerve their Laws, and to reduce or continue their people to their obedience. Now as Kings are the Images of God, ſo the chief Miniſters of State are the Images of their Princes; we muſt not think then that the honour beſtowed on them is a derogation or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of their Soveraignty. No, rather the more highly the chief Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour is dignified, the more the Prince himſelf is honoured. For as Antiquity reverenceth the <hi>Oracles,</hi> and thoſe who were injurious to them affronted the Gods; ſo the ſame veneration and reſpect ought the Subjects attribute to him, who is ſo highly truſted as well for their own as their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſervice. Theſe mutual reſpects are the Nerves of the State wherewith
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96822:104"/>
the Prince move<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the whole body of the Kingdom with greater facilitie. And as the General of an Army diſperſeth his Orders and diſcovereth his deſign to a faithful Officer, (ſelected from the reſt) for a more proſperous march and conduct to the Army: ſo doth a Prince intimate his directions (perhaps) but by a Whiſper) to his Miniſter, whereby he moveth all the parts of the Kingdom in a courſe clean contrary to common and general expectations. Therefore ſuch an Officer is neceſſary, that the Prince may not only be eaſed and disburthened of ſo great a charge, and thereby be able to refreſh and ſolace himſelf, but likewiſe Policie teacheth him to prepare a ſhelter betwixt him and the outragious tempeſts of the peoples envie and reproaches, who act in that ſort, that if the Prince be indulgent to any one perſon, they become an eternal enemy to ſuch near approaches to Royalty; and the Miniſter of State receiving the beams of Authority from his Prince, ought to be like the Moon, thought leſs luminous yet ever ſplendent in one degree or other; and though by his motions he caſually eclipſe the ſplendor of the Sun, as to the eie of the people, yet as towards his Prince he is ſtill to reflect with honour, and his orb is ſpeedily to move to a more luminous ſatisfaction of the World: And when it ſo happeneth that a King enjoyeth ſuch an extraordinary perſon, who knoweth as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obey his Prince, as to command his people: the loſs of <hi>ten Battails</hi> ought to be leſs conſiderable then of one ſo eminent and ſo incomparable a creature. This Office of the Conſtable I have conſtituted as an aid and ſuccour to my ſelf; and that of the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> as Aſſiſtants to the Conſtable. And if Princes be ſo injudicious and reſolute, as in ſo great a Kingdom not to admit a Miniſter of State, but wraſtle alone with thoſe vaſt imployments, they will find thoſe different affairs which follow the Soveraignty, as the ſhaddow doth the body, will infinitely oppreſs the Princes ſoul; who if he mind his own honour and the peoples repoſe, a defatigation and diſpiritedneſs will accompany that oppreſſion; and that will produce vexation and melancholy, which is provoked ordinarily into choller; and that commonly prepares high acts of injuſtice: therefore to keep up the vigour of the Prince in an equal proportion, the prudence and fidelity of a chief <hi>Miniſter of State</hi> is incomparably neceſſary. Soveraign Princes are like the Captains and chief Commanders in the Gallies, where the ſervice of the Pilot is of the cheifeſt importance to guide the courſe; it is his office to foreſee the tempeſts, to diſcover the winds, to avoid the ſhelves and rocks; and they rarely or never govern the Helm, but when the Pilot is diſobedient, or a neceſſity forceth: they (at pleaſure) obſerve the Carte, though neither furle the Sails, handle the Ropes, nor tug at an Oar: it is enough for the Captains to give their orders, to reſerve themſelves for their more noble functions, which are to fight and vanquiſh the enemies: yet in neceſſity the Captain ought to be capable to exerciſe any place in all the Veſſel; either of a skilful Pilot, or a private Sea-man. Thus as an exact Pilot, the chief Miniſter of State is to be prudent and active, either in the quiet and calms, or ſtorms and tempeſts, when they ariſe in the State. If God would have Kings made ſo perfect and abſolute as that they ſhould need no aſſiſtance or Councellor, then they had been more by their birth then men; they might have penetrated their Subjects hearts, and been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being deceived: but ſeeing it hath pleaſed the Divine Power to make them equal in their infirmities to the meaneſt of their Subjects, they have great reaſon to fortifie their diſabilities by addition of the moſt rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal helps and aſſiſtances: now as ſome objects, ſo the affairs of Kingdoms
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96822:105"/>
may be better ſeen by a multiplyed Light. I know well that Hiſtory (which paſſeth for the beſt and moſt impartial Deſcriber of the Univerſe) teacheth Kings ſomething; that more obſcurely and imperfectly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of effective experience. I may add alſo that Cuſtoms, Manners, and Kingdoms, change as well as times. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> are not now thoſe noble perſons, who fought under <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; the <hi>Romans</hi> of our age are grown more ſoft and delicate, and are not ſuch who lived under <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa Pompillius;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> themſelves, though hot and fiery, have left that hardſhip and fierceneſs which they had under the reign of <hi>Pharamond</hi> and <hi>Meroije,</hi> under <hi>Clodion</hi> and <hi>Clovis,</hi> their courage was then formidable to all Nations. Princes born in the Purple Chamber of Royalty, uſually travail into other Countries by their Maps and Charts; and ſeldom march into other Territories, but with puiſſant Armies to enlarge their Conqueſts and Dominions. It is then moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to a Prince to have a confidence in ſome eminent perſon who may ſatisfie his curioſity with truth, and can experimentally deſcribe by his travails, the Kingdoms and Countreys of his Enemies, it being almoſt impoſſible to make his advantages without the advice of thoſe who have ſeen thoſe places with their own eyes. And whereas Princes by reaſon of their ſuperabundant affairs cannot be ſo contemplative, nor ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Books; and that Prudence is much gained with travail and converſation with ſtrangers: a learned Councellour of Eſtate may in his diſcourſe be uſed as a walking Library. Beſides, Splendor, Pomp, and Pleaſure, deprive a King of a great part of his life; ſo that it may be ſaid in ſome kind, 'Tis neceſſary for a Prince to have ſome others to live for him; to adviſe him on all occaſions, and to inſtruct him in thoſe things which his interrupted condition permits him not to underſtand. And who think you is ſo fit to report to his Prince thoſe bold truths and free expreſſions, which it is neceſſary he ſhould underſtand, but he to whom he hath given Commiſſion, and in whom he hath placed his confidence. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny angry truths, which Kings ought to know, and yet are not to be related to them, but ſeaſonably, and by a skilful and learned faithful Councellour; who having firſt digeſted the dangers, may direct his Maſter to avoid the extremities. For the ſame relations reported from an ignorant or an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious mouth may occaſion great diſtempers, and many evils: ſo that a faithful Miniſter compleatly qualified with all vertues, is the chiefeſt guard to the perſon of his Prince. When I look on the Court, I ſee it full of flatterrers and male contents; ſome endeavouring to raiſe diſſentions, others labouring to corrupt with Sycophancie and adulation: therefore in conſideration of thoſe two different dangers and inconveniencies; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes are rather to be applyed firſt to the chief Miniſter, then to the Prince; who as he is a guard, ſo he is a buckler and ſpye to all intentions that may ſurprize the King; and theſe obligations indear his fidelity to his Maſter together with his own fortune, his life, and honour. Now as touching my ſelf, theſe Reaſons have been my Directors, and I deſire my Succeſſors may practice that which I have given them in example. The Laws ſhall be my guide and rules, and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> and <hi>Marſhals</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> on whom I have conferred the Military affairs, ſhall force and command them to an obſervation. It is by them whereby I ſhall ſupport my Throne, whereunto I am aſcended; and it is by this diſcourſe which I have made, whereby I ſhall prevent my Succeſſors from an evil explication of my reſolutions; and that they may beleive that my ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Major</hi> of the <hi>Pallace,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:96822:105"/>
was to make them more abſolute in the Regal Office, I wiſh my Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors may reign with full Authority; but I deſire alſo that they debar not themſelves from the prudence of a faithful Councellor. I would not have them ſlaves to their chief Miniſter, and yet I adviſe them to ſubmit to Experience and Reaſon; and having found ſage, moderate, faithful, and vertuous ſervants, that they love them, recompence, and protect them, and that they meaſure their friendſhid, favours, and bounty, with their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, excellency, and perfection of their ſervices.</p>

                  <p>KINGS are <hi>Gods,</hi> ſo ſaith the Scripture; but they are ſuch Gods, of whom <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpeaks, who are ſubject to anger, fear, hatred, love, and all humane Paſsions. As happy as Kingdoms and Princes may be, they are content to obſerve the Latine Proverb, which teacheth them, that <hi>two eyes ſee more then one;</hi> and therefore commit not their affairs abſolutely to the dictates of their own will, matters of weight: Regal and high affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire counſell and aſsiſtance; which if Kings refuſe and ſcorn their condition grows deſperate and dangerous. <hi>All Wiſdom cometh from above,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> and 'tis for this reaſon why Kings ought not to be aſhamed of their conſultations, meeting with ſo many difficulties. The nobleneſs of birth renders Kings illuſtrious and worthy of great eſteem, and moſt ſublime admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and it is true, Where the King is, there is the Court, though it be but in a Cottage. But ſeeing they are men as well as Kings, Monarchs were unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able if they refuſed Councel and advice: S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth that <hi>Princes are to be obeyed though evil and wicked;</hi> yet he never taught, That Princes ought not to hearken to the wiſdom of the aged, to thoſe who have more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then they. <hi>It is their duty to do right to the Meaneſt as well as to the Mightieſt.</hi> This is an inſtruction given to all the Grand Maſters of the earth. And how ſhall Princes obey the Commandments of heaven if they be ignorant of what is right, and will not hear their Councels who can adviſe them? <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith in the ſecond Book of his Republique, That <hi>it is a high injuſtice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Righteous, and not really to be ſo.</hi> He addeth farther, <hi>He is equally injuſt who taketh Councel from none but himſelf;</hi> as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> who wedded himſelf reſolutely to his own opinion. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who was ſo noble in his reſolutions, that in the <hi>Olimpyan</hi> Games he would conteſt and exerciſe with none but Kings, yet he refuſed not to conſult with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who was no King, but a ſage Philoſopher. The ſublimity of his condition did not make him ſcorn or diſdain the wiſdom of his Councel. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the multitude of Councellors conſiſteth ſafety.</hi> And that which he taught he practiſed; firſt chooſing able and faithful Councellours, and then depending on their fidelity. <hi>Wiſdom eſtabliſheth a firm foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (ſaith the infallible Oracle) and to have ſuch an aſſurance, faithful Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are to be embraced. And though the danger may be great, when a Councellor proves unable or unfaithful; yet it is greater prudence to adventure ſuch a danger, then to walk headlong in a certain path of ruine and deſtruction. It is true, Princes unfortunately, ſometimes meet with ſuch falſe and perfidious Councellours as <hi>Sejanus;</hi> but there are to be found likewiſe upright and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Mordeca's, Agrippa's, Maecenas's,</hi> and <hi>Belliſarius,</hi> that is, ſuch incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96822:106"/>
Worthies, who having no ſingle and private Intereſt, regard nothing above their Maſters glory and his Kingdoms good. Such men as theſe are fit to ſit at the Councel Tables with Kings; of whom it may be candidly ſaid, as the <hi>Oracle</hi> did of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> (though by the mouth of a Sorcerer) that <hi>ſuch as he were beloved of the Gods, and were rather</hi> (indeed) <hi>Gods then Men:</hi> and <hi>as for Princes, their ruine is never more certain and near, then when they deſpiſe wholſome Councel.</hi> Therefore the Wiſe man ſaid, <hi>Rebuke the wiſe and he will give thee thanks.</hi> Now as the Prince is to hearken to his faithful Miniſter; ſo is he to premeditate and guard his lips, that they <hi>utter no perverſe or indiſcreet thing</hi> before the Prince; but by wiſdom to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy to ſtand before Kings, and to approve his worth in ſo high a truſt; and ſo a skilful Pilot in ſo dangerous a Navigation and Voyage. It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite his <hi>Theorie</hi> be great but that his <hi>Practice</hi> exceed that. He is to keep himſelf within the bounds of awful obedience to his Prince, to underſtand that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of Kings is not limited, their <hi>anger is as the roaring of a Lion,</hi> and their <hi>Soveraignty is as the heart of man, where every wound is mortal</hi> It is with Soveraignty as with the Ark of the Covenant, which none ought to preſume to touch, though it were to ſupport it. Having now ſeen the reaſons of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> and his election of a Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> let us travail more Northerly, and look on a famous <hi>Hero,</hi> that formidable Conqueror, whom we may ſtile as that Turkiſh Emperour <hi>Gulderum,</hi> that is, the Lightning from Heaven; who when he had paſſed over the Baltick Sea, and ſet his feet in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many being in the head of his Army; he commonly expoſed himſelf to the dangers of a private Souldier, not conſidering his quality of being a King, but (when he had occaſion) to ſhew his Royal Grace and Mercy to his humbled and vanquiſhed Enemies. And therefore his ſage and faithful Chancellour preſumed to take the liberty to reprehend his Majeſtie. See here follow the reaſons of this Lion-like couragious Prince, to authorize and justifie his Gallantry and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in what he uſually attempted.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Councels which you have given me for a ſafer guard to my ſelf, had not been as dangerous, as my enemies to my renown and honour; I could have ſo much valued your wiſdom and fidelity, as to have hearkened to your Policie and Advice; but my honour was more precious to me then the conſideration of my Eſtate and life, and more nearly toucheth my heart. Wherefore I think it fit to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your curioſity (in matters ſo highly important:) I preſume the valor of Kings is not a quality to be confined or lockt up within the narrow bounds of any limits; much leſs within the preſcriptions which your Policy perſwadeth.

The ſame circumſtances are not commonly uſed to the ſame events, but <hi>diſtinct and different means of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten compaſs the ſame ends.</hi> One Ship may come ſafely to the Harbour by the Tide, and another as proſperouſly (though againſt the Tide) by a good gale of wind. As all Kings are not alike, neither in their perſons, nor Kingdoms; ſo their intereſts leave them to the choice and exerciſes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral actions and undertakings. There are many Circumſtances moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially conſiderable in them, as their age, their humour, their inclination. And it is to be obſerved that the people are of one temper, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of another; thoſe love to loiter and ſhelter themſelves in Plenty and Peace; theſe delight to hear the ſound of Trumpet and Drums, and are more ambitious of honour then of riches. To theſe obſervations a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard muſt be uſed to the affairs of War, to the nature of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and to the deſigns of Conqueſt and Victory. And according to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96822:108"/>
variety of thoſe objects in theſe ſeveral circumſtances; the life of man (in order to thoſe ends he aims at) is to be more or leſs valued. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a King is to conſider, whether it may not be as neceſſary (on ſome occaſions) to appear (as well) a valiant and ſtout Souldier, as a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander and General. But not to ſtay you any longer from the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Reaſons, I hope you will yeild rationally, that <hi>Valour is a quality, as eſſential to a King, as either Juſtice or Prudence;</hi> and that (in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) it is more advantagious and ſerviceable to the People, then to the Prince, who chiefly gains honour and renown; but as for other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, they are as equally communicable to the Subjects (who freely ſhare in them) as to the Soveraign. It is true, Policy and Prudence may effect Victories with leſs danger, and without effuſion of bloud; and thoſe Conqueſts may be both glorious and commodious: yet I ſhall ſpeak freely and without fear, although Juſtice and Prudence are chief preſervers of a State in peace, yet the Vallour and fortitude of the Prince is as equally conſiderable; and contributeth not the leaſt ſhare of advantage to the proſperity of a Kingdom. Nay, more valour chiefly giveth the life, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and fortune, and with magnanimity and courage the nobleſt minds do ever keep company; 'tis this vertue which maketh the greateſt ſpirits and Worthies moſt remarkable; ſhe (above all others) advanceth Kings and Princes. It is by her renown that Kingdoms and Empires are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and formed; and whereby Conquerours all Illuſtrious Heroes are reputed worthy to merit Crowns and Diadems: for if we examine the wayes and motions of theſe latter ages; we ſhall find that men who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were diſciplined in the Rules of Morality and Policy, out of an inſtinct and direction from Nature, judged none worthy to command, but thoſe whom they conceived moſt daring and valiant. So true it is, that <hi>valour</hi> is a quality moſt eſſential to Royalty, and conſequently thoſe who are not endowed with this great vertue, are utterly unworthy and incapable of Crowns and Scepters. If Kings were only obliged to be their Subjects Lords and Maſters, Prudence and Juſtice might be ſolely requiſite to ſuch relations of Government; but their royal office obligeth them farther to adventure for their defence, not only by their Commands, but in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And it is through this noble quality that they gain the glorious titles of victorious <hi>Conquerors,</hi> and to be ſtiled the <hi>Protectors</hi> and <hi>Liberators</hi> of the People. It was in favour to this more eminent vertue, that the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> (who were ſuch equal diſpenſators of Glory) conferred honours, and gave triumphs to thoſe, who by their illuſtrious Atchievements had merited ſuch high renown. But you will tell me, all men confeſs <hi>valour</hi> to be a great ornament and Princely requiſite in a Soveraign: but it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leſs uſeful if not limited with <hi>moderation</hi> and guided with diſcreet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints. To anſwer, I ſhall not peremptorily make a contradiction; yet I ſhall boldly affirm, that all the vertues when idle and leſs active, either ceaſe to be vertues, or (at leaſt) appear not ſo to be. What where Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency if ſhe never ſnatched a ſacrifice from the Altar of Juſtice? and what were Juſtice if ſhe remitted all her victims to Clemency? There is then a kind of neceſſity which generally obligeth them to a Conſiſtency in action; and each particular is to act according to its Nature; and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelf to the people, as that vertue which is moſt eminent in the Prince, and chiefly ſeated in his natural inclinations. Now <hi>if the Prince diſcerneth that his Subjects do more honor him, his Souldiers grow daily more valiant, and his Enemies more fear him; it cannot but be neceſſary, that he make proofs of</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:96822:108"/>
                  <hi>his courage to encreaſe the ſubjects loyalty and the Souldiers valour,</hi> that the Enemies may be poſſeſſed with more terrour and fear, and the Eſtate be eſtabliſhed in a greater ſecurity. Beſides, where nature hath imprinted this noble heat and ardour of ſpirit, it is proper to augment and enflame this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſpark, by an exerciſe and frequency of noble actions; and <hi>he who paſſeth his dayes without peril, is too raſh or vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>glorious, if he brag much of his courage.</hi> It is not enough for a Prince to hear the noiſe of the Cannons, and to ſee the ſmoak and flaſhes of fire from the Ramparts and Battalians: but valour leadeth a gallant ſpirit within the midſt of the flaming clouds, and mingleth him boldly with the enemies troops; where he can look on death without fear, and ſeeks glory when he ſcorns the world: and ſo walking betwixt the living and the dead, gathers <hi>Lawrels</hi> and <hi>Trophies</hi> with his own hands, which he hath beſprinkled with the ſweat and bloud of his irreconcileable Enemies. If this noble boldneſs were not admitted to a Prince, his own Army might as well doubt as the Enemies themſelves of the Princes valour; and the Souldiers and Officers might juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves the victory which crowneth Kings. This high quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not only neceſſary for a Prince in the <hi>Theorie</hi> and <hi>Speculation,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the <hi>Practice:</hi> ſome other vertuos are commendable, but this not only ſo, but eſſential in a Prince. <hi>Juſtice and Prudence may be inſpired by the advice of faithful Councellours, but valour muſt lodge in the Princes heart,</hi> which giveth life and motion (as the moſt noble part) to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Members. And how can a Prince who feeleth not in himſelf the height of vigour and courage manage his affairs in either Peace or Wars? Firſt if he live in the ſoftneſs of Plenty, and a peaceful Eſtate, how apt will ſuch a Prince be to be oppoſed and affronted by the injuſtice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency of his own Subjects? how will his neighbour Princes and Eſtates domineer and encroach on his Royal Rights and Priviledges? and it he fall into the tempeſt and broils of a Civil War, or an invaſion from foreign Enemies; how will he be able to preſerve his own honour, or his ſubjects Rights and Liberties? and what noble ſpirit will freely adventure his life in his ſervice, who dare not as freely hazard his own? or how can he be capable of Generous Councel, who hath not courage nor valour to put it in execution? and how dare that perſon think himſelf worthy of the Title of King, who hath not a heart to fight (if fortune ſhould oblige him) in a ſingle Duel with his equal) for the honour and preſervation of his Crown? By this time (I think) I may impartially conclude, that <hi>valour is the moſt Princely and moſt Royal ornament,</hi> and hath the precedency (on the Throne) above all other vertues, which without this could not render any perſon fit to wear a glorious Crown. In all great Battails ſhe alone hath made the Conquerors moſt illuſtrious and fortunate. You cannot then (noble Chancellor) but acknowledge that as this vertue is neceſſary and glorious for the Prince: ſo it is of chiefeſt advantage for the Peoples good and univerſal happineſs. Now this foundation laid, let us ſee how this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be uſed; and whether to be unactive and out of all imployment; So propoſing to forget no circumſtance that may juſtifie our courage in theſe actions, which I have or ſhall undertake in expoſing my life to the moſt eminent perils of War. It is moſt certain, that if it ought (at any time) to ſhine more eminently in a Prince, it ſhould be at the Commenceme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of his life, of his reign, and of his conqueſts: this is the chiefeſt inſtance, when a Prince makes the luſtre of his Crown to ſhine, and when he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth the marks of honour in the hearts of his friends and enemies; his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96822:109"/>
courage amazing the one, and animating the others: <hi>Whoever hath a hand valiant enough to ſerve gloriouſly with his Sword, need not fear or doubt but that he may ſway the Grandure of a Scepter;</hi> and to this purpoſe (on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions) a Noble Prince is obliged to give ſolemn teſtimonies of his valour. As for all other vertues, they cannot appear ſo eminently in him: Juſtice and Clemency may flow from his inviſible orders; but valour is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately tranſcient from his perſon. Experience maketh grand Politicians and great Captains; but they can never gain the reputation of valour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own perſonal appearance. This is a way to honour, to which an illiterate and private Souldier may be admitted to climb. And how ſhall a Prince render himſelf commendable to his Subjects, or formidable to his Enemies; who is not furniſhed with this glorious quality? Kingly affairs admit not alwayes leaſure to books, nor ſolitary hours of ſtudy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. His office is ever to be active, and <hi>valour</hi> is a Native quality which encreaſeth with exerciſe. This is a guift of nature, and falls from the hand of Heaven, and is imbodied in the life of man; ſo conſequently, being a natural inclination, inſtructeth that Prince ſo qualified, that he imploy the vertue thereof for the good of his Eſtate, and the glory of his Renown. If Nature had intended otherwiſe, Prudence or Juſtice might have bin a more early quality then Valour; but we ſee the contrary, and the youngeſt Infants ſooner learn to ſhew their courage, then to expreſs the vigour of any other vertues. The order which is eſtabliſhed in all the Univerſe is too juſt to be contradicted; and men can never do more judiciouſly then by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rules of natural and primitive intentions. Agriculture (how fertile and fruitful ſoever it improves) expects not the flower before the bloſſom, nor the fruit before the flower. The skilful Gardner endeavours to haſten the maturity of his fruits; but not to change or diſorder their Nature. Thoſe who approach near the Thrones of Princes, ought not to preſume to infuſe the Rules of Prudence into their Princes ears, before they have given him firm aſſurances of their courage; <hi>Crowns though they are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Councellours, yet not with Cowards:</hi> and Princes make their beſt advantage, when (following the direction of Nature) their Valour is firſt diſcerned and moſt illuſtrious in them. The ſuſpition of not being coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, may diſanimate the ſtouteſt Subjects, and encourage the baſeſt and loweſt Enemies. And if Valour alone effecteth ſuch noble enterpriſes, what will not the prudently Couragious be able to atcheive? In effect, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble report which dilateth it ſelf at the Commencement of a Princes reign, is marvellous important to all the concernments of his life. As for renown, ſhe will take more pleaſure in proclaiming of his valour, then of his bounty; and flying round the world, will more divulge and blazon his honour, and the effects of his courage, then thoſe of his Prudence and Juſtice. Hiſtory will charge her ſelf voluntarily with the memory of his Victories which he hath gained over his Enemies, and make them to ſhadow his errors (if any) and the infirmities of his paſſion. The reſt of his vertues clad in a more ſilent robe, or lapt up in private Panegyricks will ſhine as they are ſhadowed from the Pencils of private perſons. But as for all the circumſtances of his valour, they ſhall ſwell in Volums of univerſal Hiſtory. His other qualities may be contented to be confined to the borders of his own Dominions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: but his valour will conſtantly travail over all the Univerſe. His friends and his enemies will both talk; theſe out of love, thoſe out of fear; both will ſpeak his honor, and ſo immortalize the glory of a valiant Prince: ſo that no perſon ſhall be able to detract or derogate from his renown. In the Conduct
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96822:109"/>
of War, much is (ofttimes) attributed to the experience of the General, or to the Reſult of Councell: but no dimunition can rob a valiant ſpirit of his honor. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> added ſomething to the Glory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by the infuſion of ſweetneſs and moderation, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> did in that kind, in that of <hi>Trajan;</hi> but neither the one nor the other inſpired their valour and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. All the Tracts which were ever written, cannot preſent the guifts of fortitude. Heaven and Nature concur in the plantation of that quality in the hearts of men. The Battail of <hi>D'Iſſus,</hi> and that of <hi>Arbella,</hi> were ſo much <hi>Alexanders;</hi> and that of <hi>Daces</hi> ſo much <hi>Trajans,</hi> that the Combats and the Victories were their own entirely: where no perſon durſt preſume to claim a ſhare or part in thoſe honorable enterpriſes. It was (without doubt) that the <hi>Illuſtrious Macedonian</hi> (on this ſole occaſion) would not admit that <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> ſhould be named with <hi>Alexander</hi> in that action; it being certain that Valour is the only Miſtreſs, of which all noble Heroes are tender and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Now if it be advantagious to a Prince to be valiant being young, it is much more rational to be couragious when he is firſt a King. As for my ſelf, If I had not rendred my reign more memorable by my firſt actions againſt the <hi>Polanders</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> it might well have been that I ſhould not have cauſed (at this preſent) the <hi>Empire,</hi> and all <hi>Germany</hi> to tremble: but on the contrary (perhaps) I might have ſeen all mine own Territories invaded, or my ſelf forced to a ſhameful exile, or confined to a baſe impriſonment. It is certain that the moſt important actions of a King (in all his life) are thoſe when he firſt mounteth towards his Throne; &amp; then when he declares a War againſt a formidable and puiſſant Enemy. And yet not to leave the intereſt of that noble Subject (of which we ſpeak) when conjunctures grow dangerous, and innovations threaten a change of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Prince is then to be moſt vigorous, and to fortifie his deſigns with his courage. In the ſuſpition of great revolutions, terror and fear are excellent means to keep the world cloſe to their duty; and on the contrary, timidity, ſlow and dull conſultations do but prepare and promote Revolts, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage factions &amp; ſeditions. For though valor do not always act w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> her ſword in her hand; yet ſhe hath a conſtant influence and continued operation over all the people. She enters into the Councels as wel as Prudence, and though Prudence give advice, it is valor that receiveth and acteth the bold and hardy reſolutions; and ſhe is the chiefeſt cauſe that inclineth Princes to clemency. If <hi>Jul. Caeſar</hi> had not bin truly valiant, he could not have pardoned his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies. As for Fear it ſuffers not thoſe to live whom true Valour ſcorns, great and terrible Murders had followed in the battails of <hi>Pharſalia.</hi> If that great Emperor had not ſcorn'd death, he would have cauſed ſlain the greateſt number of the <hi>Romans. Auguſtus</hi> forbore his proſcriptions and Maſſacres on the Triumvirats only on this ground, being certain that his valor &amp; courage did ſo tranſcend, that it could cauſe his inclinations to mercy. It was this that preſerved <hi>Cinna</hi> from periſhing, when his conſpiracies had trained him to ſuch perils, and <hi>Livia</hi> ſo much ſolicited againſt him for his ruine. All no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heroes have done nothing worthy, their memory wherein their valour hath not bin moſt prevalent in their perſwaſions &amp; reſolutions As for <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards they dare not reſolv whether to puniſh or pardon,</hi> but in a ſuſpence; fearing the complices or the conſpirators, they leſs incline to pardon: &amp; cruelty being their natural inclination, their fears increaſe only, and they deſire to ruine all; provided that that deſolation might render ſecurity and repoſe to themſelvs. This Paſſion doth worſe becom Kings, whom if the Subjects once diſcern to be timerous, they ſpeedily grow inſolent &amp; probably cauſe their Scepter to fal out of their trembling hands. But on the contrary a Prince ſhould rather
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96822:110"/>
endeavour not only to be terrible in the apprehenſion of his own Subjects, but he is to make his courage to appear formidable to all the earth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally then when he ſits upon a Throne. At that time this glorious quality imprinteth his reſpect with his Grandees and Nobles, and diſperſeth an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubmiſſion in the hearts of his people; and thus his courage command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the one and the other, Peace and publique Tranquility proveth the reſult and conſequence. Will a Prince pardon a great and eminent perſon, let him do it franckly without any regard to the ſuſpition of his Train or Party, and look on him as an object of his mercy, not of his fear. And when he reſolves to puniſh a potent and eminent offender, let him effect it with equal courage, and let his valour ſurmount all oppoſition and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie: let him as little fear death by the hand of an aſſaſſinate, as from the Army of an Enemy. <hi>He hath true repoſe of ſpirit who preſerveth his reaſon entire, and neither lyes down nor riſeth up in fear:</hi> For Valour makes him vigilant and ſuſpicious, not baſe and timerous. In this condition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath Peace or War, his Valour will make him worthy to be a King, and to be attended with honour. There is a time when young and tender age tolerates a Prince if he be not prudent and politique (that vertue is not gained but with riper years, and ſome experience:) but it is a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection (if not a vice) for a Prince even from his Cradle, not to manifeſt the ſeeds of valour. It muſt be then confeſſed clearly, that no occaſion muſt be omitted that may manifeſt the beauty of this incomparable vertue, which is ſo precious at all ſeaſons. And if a Prince may be permitted at any time to take off the edge, and ſo ſuſpend the ſplendour of his courage; it is principally then, when he hath atchieved his conqueſts; then, when he reapeth the full harveſt of his victories; but in his attempts he is to be as hardy and terrible as a Lion, that by a fortunate beginning he may make his paſſage eaſie and facile to his greateſt future enterpriſes, and ſo to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred formidable and victorious: it is not only neceſſary to fight by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but in perſon, as well to encourage their own Armies, as terrifie and amaze the Enemies. By ſuch a Gallant deportment the Reputation of a Prince wil march far before the Prince himſelf, and proclaim farther the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch a General, then the ſound of Drums or Trumpets. His luſtre will be ſeen farther then his Enſigns and Banners; and ſo the very terrour of his great and noble Name will batter the Walls, and open the gates of the ſtrongeſt Forts and greateſt Towns. As for thoſe quiet and ſleepy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who have no other thoughts, but for their own defence; and no other ambition but to guard their own Dominions from the Invaſion of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; a leſſer proportion of this noble quality may ſerve ſuch thrifty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: yet this high vertue, if planted in breſts of Soveraign Power, ought not to be confined to ſuch narrow bounds; for if there be no occaſion to enlarge their Domination, there cannot be wanting ſome excellent and honourable motive to exerciſe their courage in relieving of ſome Noble Princes enduring an oppreſſion or uſurpation. But as for ſuch who after the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, mind Heroick and Noble enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; they think it glorious to quit their own Countries, preferring danger before a Bed of Down, and the glory of the Camp before the delicacies of the Court: they can ſeat Majeſty as high in ſtrange Countries as well as in their own; and create and elevate a Throne with a few clods and earthie turfs, and make that as terrible as covered all over with gold. Such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and magnanimous ſpirits adventure to ſeek Death abroad, and reſolve either to gain glory and an Empire, or to ſcorn Danger and trample Death
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96822:110"/>
under foot. Such invincible minds as theſe, are more active and couragious, they ſhake off dull and drowſie humours, kiſs their Sword as their Miſtreſs, look on Fame as their Herauld and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and expect honour as their reward. Theſe Martial Heroes abandoning fear will adventure their own perſons (which are above and far more precious then all things elſe) to gain what they aime at, and thoſe who will be ſuperabundantly and tediouſly wiſe, are ſeldome more fortunate or more illuſtrious then what their birth and their Fathers valour hath made them. Beſides theſe Arguments, if I ſhall conſider the three ages of Man, his youth, his manhood, and his old age; the ſeaſon wherein I have chiefly exerciſed courage is moſt ſuitable and proper, which is equally diſtanced from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the one, and the debilities of the other. When the ſtrength of body accompanied the vigor of the mind, at which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture it were a thing more irrational, and a kind of an affront and abuſe to Nature, not to be then more ſprightful and active; and conſequently more ambitious of an immortal and a glorious name. If Experience be ſo perfect a guide in great and famous enterpriſes, ought I not then to do now as I have already, ſo often having ſo well ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded? you know how that when I was but ſeventeen years of age; I was conſtrained (on the ſame day) to take my Scepter with one hand, and my Sword in the other, and ſo forced to defend my Crown: how I was (at thoſe years) invaded by the <hi>Danes, Polanders,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> and while theſe Wars continued I found it moſt agreeable with my honor as well as with my affairs to be with the firſt in the field, and with the laſt at the retreat. I believe you cannot forget thoſe eminent effects which I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in all theſe ſeveral Countries, and with what precipitation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable danger I have been (ofttimes ſeen) to paſs the Frontiers of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Muſcovie,</hi> and from thoſe of <hi>Muſcovie</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Polony:</hi> and if I had on thoſe occaſions ſo much need, I have (at preſent) equal invitation to the greateſt activity of my perſonal valour. For as the deſign is more high and noble, ſo ought all circumſtances which aim at it. Beſides ſome permiſſion is due to my natural inclinations, that I may regulate my conduct according (to my previſion and foreſight) with better ſucceſſes. And if I ſhould continue with the main body of my Army I might (probably) not onely endanger and hazard my ſelf, but all. No, it is more proper that I go my ſelf and view the countenance and ſquadrons of my Enemies, if I intend to vanquiſh them. I ſhall thereby put more life and reſolution into my own Souldiers; and when they fight I ſhall the more ably diſcern how to take a more perfect advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on the Enemies forces, or feebleneſs, with whom I am to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. And as I have conſidered what is moſt neceſſary in Order to mine own intereſt, ſo I am to diſcern the inclinations of the People and Souldiers who follow me. All Climats produce not the ſame tempers, and my Souldiers being of a more Northerly birth and education, expect a more vigorous and active example for their conduct. Not but that they are valiant, ſtout, and hardy; yet withal, they like the adventures better, when their Commanders are in the Vanguard, and the General in the Front of the Battail: and it were great ſhame and imprudence, not to be forward where one noble Example may ſo elevate their courage and reſolution.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96822:111"/>
The coldneſs of the Climate hath ſome communication with theit Nature, which being warmed and throughly enflamed by their Princes valour, the Souldiers ſcorn Death and Danger, and grow as ambitious of vanquiſhing the Enemies, as the Prince himſelf; and if their courage be not ſomewhat quickned and advanced by ſome eminent and notable action of their Prince, it may fall out that they may fail in their duty; and the Prince may (poſſibly) loſe his honour, with his life, and all that is dear unto him. To theſe reaſons I may farther add, that Prince who finds himſelf not at the head of an Army, conſiſtent of an hundred thouſand men, but onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a leſſer number of Troops and Regiments, in caſe his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers march ſlowly, and advance fearfully; ſuch a Prince ought to be able roundly to tell his timorous and daunted Souldiers, that his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is as conſiderable as the vaſt numbers of the Enemies forces; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he had done more diſcreetly not to have commenced a War, but rather lived ſecurely in peace. And it is alſo as true when a Prince taketh a view of his Army, and examineth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines of Ammunition, he ought at the ſame time to conſult with his owne heart, and not ſo much depend on the numbers of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or the ſtrength and terrour of his Engines, as on his owne cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and magnanimity. Moreover, if we conſider well who our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are, we ſhall finde they are the very ſame, who fought ſo ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and cauſed ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Legions to periſh and fall. Yes, they are the very ſame People with whoſe force and power Grand <hi>Arminius</hi> (that noble Captain) did ſo many things. Moſt, or all other Nations are clean changed from thoſe Martial and Warlike humours, wherewith they were ſo illuſtrious for their hoſtility. <hi>Rome</hi> is not now what it was in <hi>Julius Caeſars</hi> reigne, but is grown more effeminate and delicate. Or if it ſtill continue glorious, it is more for the Arts and Sciences which flouriſh beſt in Peace, then for the exerciſe of War; and more honoureth (at preſent) the Rules of <hi>Mercury,</hi> then of <hi>Mars.</hi> The noble <hi>Macedonians</hi> are grown diſpirited and ſervile ſlaves; and the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> is not what it was under the reign of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> but they lead the lives of humble Vaſſals, contented with ſervitude and beſotted ignorance. But <hi>Germany</hi> is ſtill the ſame, the People as couragious and warlike as in the times of the <hi>Romans;</hi> as able and reſolute for reſiſtance, and ſo ſucceſsful with their valour as never entirely ſubdued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by that mighty Empire. That very place where <hi>Varrus</hi> loſt his life as well as the Battail, continues ſtill peopled with as many ſtout and brave mindes as it was, when it oppoſed all the <hi>Roman Forces.</hi> There is onely this difference, that our Arms and undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are more juſtifiable then theirs; and therefore if we intend to vanquiſh them we muſt take the ſame courſe which they uſed who conquered the World, committing our ſelves and fortunes volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to Providence; and couragiouſly expoſing our ſelves (without all fear) with hopes to attain that glorious end, at which our valour aimeth. It is for the liberties of all <hi>Germany,</hi> that we have taken up our Arms; it is for the repoſe and ſafety of our Friends and Allies, it is for a juſt revenge upon our Enemies, and true glory and renown, that we deſire victory: and conſequently, ſuch great Atchievements

muſt be attended with all diligent and noble Circumſtances that may procure and facilitate our Conqueſts. To this purpoſe (if there be occafior) I muſt not refuſe to be <hi>General</hi> of the Army, <hi>Martial</hi> of the field, <hi>Major General,</hi> an ordinary <hi>Captain, Engineer, Canoneer,</hi> or a <hi>private Souldier,</hi> as well as a <hi>King;</hi> and thus according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of my affairs, I am to proceed and act as an experienc'd and forward Prince, who know my owne buſineſs as well or better then any who fight or follow me. Thoſe who conclude that a Prince is the life and ſoul of his Army, are ſurely of my judgment, and reſolve where the undertakings are ſo great and illuſtrious, the way cannot but be dangerous, and therefore requires greater courage as well as policy. The ſoul (we know) <hi>eſt tota in toto,</hi> as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſaith, and ſo muſt the Prince be in every part of his Army, giving life and operation to every member; ſo cauſing the feet to march, the hands to fight, the ears to hearken, the eyes to watch, and all parts to perform their ſeveral duties: have you not obſerved with what order and courage my Souldiers have followed me, when I have marched in the head of my army; ſpecially then, when I lead them towards the very mouth of danger: And think you that if they lead me and I followed them, that they would have advanced with equal courage? No, no, I know that one ſtroke with my Sword ſtrikes the Enemie as deep as a thouſand of others of lower quality: And <hi>What doth not ſhame, example, emulation, hope of honour, expectation of Reward, and recompence from the hands of a King.</hi> What (I ſay) doth not ſuch means effect and operate? This Intuition and care moveth effectually every particular perſon in the Army, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth each one to do his duty impartially; ſo that ſome may rudely interpret that temerity which proveth greateſt prudence: but (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) you may tell me; if the Enemy underſtand that I am da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly in the head of my Army, they will aim at none ſo much, as at my ſelf; and therefore multiply their volleys againſt me: to that I anſwer, <hi>It is no ſmal degree of honour to be ſuch an object of terrour, and ſuch a noble mark, which ſcorneth the enemies forces, though never ſo numerous.</hi> Beſides, my Souldiers who ſee my valour, cannot but be ſo ambitious of my preſervation, as to guard me with the wiſhes of their hearts, as well as defend me with the ſtoutneſs of their hands; and whatever ſhall ſucceed, the preſence of majeſty cannot but make them fight like Lions, when they ſee their Prince ingaged, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with equal danger; as for mine Enemies, ſuch couragious On-ſets would make them faint and fly, or gallantly force their Pikes and Swords to fall from their hands. Now as my preſence will inſpire courage into thoſe of my Army, ſo it will diſpoil and ſtrip the Enemy of that noble quality, and ſo force them to ſubmit to our invincible ſpirit and courage: where, if I ſhould proceed leſs generouſly, I might probably rather give incouragement, then gain ſo many conqueſts of mine Enemy. I know <hi>the way to honour is full of difficulties,</hi> but it is true, as rich mines lie deep and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; beautiful Lyllies grow in the midſt of Thornes; ſo is it with true Renown and Glory. I am not Ignorant, that death oft-times attends and areſts as familiarly the greateſt Generals and Princes, as the meaneſt Souldiers; but ſuch a death is moſt honourable,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96822:112"/>
and the Eccho thereof reſoundeth to all the Corners of the Earth. As for mine owne reſolution and humour, I had rather loſe the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, where I have the honour to fight my ſelf, then to gain a battel where I have not fought with mine owne hands. Ceaſe then (noble Chancellor) to ſet any farther limits, and to confine my courage with any bounds, leave me to the vigour and activity of this noble vertue, which ſo much animateth all the faculties of my ſoul. Our Troops are feeble, our Enemies ſtrong, our deſigns great, the eyes of all the earth obſerve our Motion, and ſuperintend our Actions; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not us then, to be ſlow or ſhort in any part of our duty; let us fight couragiouſly, let us fall upon our Enemies like a violent Torrent, with thunder and lightning; and not like a gentle River move ſlowly and timerouſly; our pretentions are not ordinary, therefore our actions muſt be generous: Let us march through all <hi>Germany,</hi> and manifeſt our courage through every part of it; and if it ſhall ſo arrive, that our valour be recompenſed with a direful ſad unfortunate concluſion, we doubt not, but that our death will be glorious, and our name immortal; and if we do not perfect our Conqueſts, the world cannot (in juſtice) but rank us in the number and order of the moſt illuſtrious Conquerours.</p>

                  <head>THE CENS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</head>
                  <p>MUch veneration and honour is due to the memory of this great Prince, he is to be looked on as a moſt noble <hi>Hero,</hi> and invincible Worthy, as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and wonder of his age: yet it is true, that Soveraign Princes having ſuch eminent fortunes, and ſo many great affairs meerly attending their perſons; it doth moſt infinitely concerne them, for the general good of their ſubjects and Souldiers, to be careful and preſervative of themſelves. That famous, but ſad day, wherein the King was ſlain, hath verified (but too cruelly) this truth, when this Prince loſt his life, by the violence and Ardor of his owne opinion; when his valour marched ſo forwardly in the Van. Though fortune had oft-times preſented him with ſucceſſes and victories, yet ſhe is not alwayes conſtant in her friendſhip. It is to be feared he was too much aſſured of the continuation of her favours, and it may be he depended too little on prudence, and too much on the <hi>Roman</hi> Proverb; which ſaid, that <hi>Deſtiny doth all;</hi> or on Predeſtination, which (as ſome ſay) orders and determines both means and ends, which is the Doctrine of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and the Turks. Though it is rather true, that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is the Artiſt of his own fortune.</hi> Philoſophy tels us as well as Poetry, that <hi>ſapiens dominabitur aſtris;</hi> a wiſe man is able to reſiſt the influence of the Stars; which though they incline, yet do not force nor conſtrain the diſpoſition. This King, though a moſt illuſtrious Prince for his valour, condeſcended very low, and appeared too exceſsively couragious in the office of a common Trooper: the head and the hand have two different functions; fortune is not always propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor doth ſhe make every Conquerour her darling, as ſhe did <hi>Alexander:</hi> that which ſhe did for him in the Town of <hi>Oxidragues,</hi> and on many re-encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are not examples to others to adventure on <hi>Alexanders</hi> dangers, or to hope for his ſucceſſes; for her favours to him may rather be accounted Prodigies and Wonders, then common degrees of fortunes courteſies. <hi>Homer</hi> who was ſo judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his <hi>Epithites,</hi> and knew how properly to place them throughout his <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads,</hi> commonly gives that of Sage or Prudent to <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> but that of Brave or Valiant to <hi>Achilles:</hi> to note the difference, which in the conduct of Armies, ought to be betwixt a royal Prince and a private perſon. It is true, that a bed of honour is as glorious and acceptable to a noble Prince, as a throne of Ivory or Gold, and to dye Tryumphantly and win the battel, is to live eternally in the memory of men. As for this Prince, if he did not (before he dyed) confine his valour to greater moderation, it was rather to be imputed his misfortune, then his errour; for having enjoyed ſo many glorious fruits of his dangers, his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and his tryumphs; why might he not ſtill have preſumed on the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs? all the world did favour him with Apologies; nay, gave him the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of honour and commendations, when he ſoſtoutly aſſaulted the Iſle of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> and at that great attempt gave ſo grand a reputation to his Armies, that he ſeemed to have effected impoſsibilities. Now if that courſe which was ſo fortunate in ſo many re-encounters, was not ſo ſucceſsful at the fatal battail of <hi>Lutzen:</hi> let the whole Earth confeſs it was not great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct but of fortune: he had already conquered above <hi>Ten Provinces,</hi> and ſubdued <hi>Three hundred Towns:</hi> why might not this day have given him leave to ſurvive his Enemies, and to have enjoyed the Triumphs of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?

but in ſome kind it may be ſaid of Wars, as tis of Playes: Old Gameſters think it not fit to hazard, and adventure all they have gained at one ſtake. But ſeeing things paſt can not be revoked; let us not farther trouble this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Hero,</hi> nor interrupt the repoſe of his Glorious Sepulchre. The great worth of this unparalleld Prince is out of the reach of envy, and (probably) of imitation. His name is too bright and glorious to be ſpotted with derogation, and tis fit for none to approach near his Aſhes, but ſuch who bedew their eyes with tears, and force an amazedneſs on their ſouls with ſighs, for the loſs of ſo great a Champion: whoſe Trophies are ſo illuſtrious, and magnificent, that whoever conſiders his great Atchievements, may not onely have an abundance of ſatisfaction for his curioſity, but be aſtoniſh't with admiration.</p>
